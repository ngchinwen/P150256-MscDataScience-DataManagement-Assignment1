Not too impressed.So I had to do the Pat's vs Geno's taste test for myself after seeing it on The Travel Channel.Lets start with the building.....it looks like Snooki & Jwoww live there.VERY GAUDY.If they put the effort they put into making the outside of the building gaudy into their Cheesesteaks then maybe their Cheesesteaks would be really good.I ordered a Cheesesteak add Provolone,American and onions.The bread was really chewy compared to Pat's and the meat was very dry.The meat to bread ratio just wasn't right either,there was just too much dry, chewy bread & too little meat.At one point while I was chewing a bite I felt like I had cotton mouth.(Beleive me,that's not a good feeling.) There was definitely less meat and cheese on my Geno's cheesesteak & overall the sandwich was just bigger at Pat's. I know that there are waaay better cheesesteak places than these 2 in Philly because we asked some locals but I had to do the ""touristy taste test ""thing for myself.The results are in, and the winner is..........Pat's. Next time I come to Philly I won't be coming to either one of these just because I wanna go try other places but if you absolutely had to choose from these 2 then it's definitely Pat's hands down.",1,"SVekW9LMVadQISwsC-4asA"

""EY, Waddayanow about steaks?"" Well, l may not know cheesesteaks, but I know what I like.   I did like the sandwich, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. It had good flavor, and I loved the onions. I ordered it ""wizz, wit"" and I was surprised how FAST they get things done. I also got the cheese fries and a drink. All in all it was around $15 (!) and I ate it right there on the benches. Yes, it was cold with the wind blowing.   The best way I can describe it is to draw a parallel observation with another LA landmark that people rave and fawn over. King Taco. Sure, they make good food. Sure they serve tons of customers every night and are rather well known. Sure they make GREAT late night stops. However, late night munchies are not really the best way to judge foodstuffs. Perhaps being soaked in booze from late night carousing adds to the overall experience. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just in the same way I like King Taco, I liked Geno's.  I however, have had better cheesesteaks. So far, the best cheesesteak I have had in the US was at Moochie's in Salt Lake City. It is not blasphemy, and it in no way takes Geno's down for what it is. A pioneer in the field of cheeseteaks with a history only perhaps one other restaurant can rival. That rivalry I am sure also adds to the legend.   Still, 3 stars for the food. -Subject to change based on intoxication-",2,"vY7MF_PQHV5WhF0SceYpWQ"

I think the steak itself is a 3.5 star product, but their hot sauce earns a star just by itself.  It's one of the best (and spiciest restaurant hot sauces I've encountered).  Give it a shot, the hot sauce makes the steak twice as good.  Be forewarned to add it sparingly -- it is hella hot.

But when our friend came to visit from overseas, I felt obligated to take her on her last night in town. Poor girl had never had a cheesesteak before.  Yeah.  Anyway, I forgot which one was the bigot, Pat or Geno, so we just rocked up to Geno's because Pat's had a bit of a line and Geno's had none. At the time it made perfect sense.   I was going to tell my boyfriend how to order, but decided against it when I realized I didn't care. After ordering at the window, the gruff lady behind the counter translated it as ""Wit Wiz"" to no one in particular. A few minutes later another gruff lady slid open another window, thrust our cheesesteak out, slid the window shut. Boyfriend waved at her to get a drink and got one filled about 2/3 of the way with ice, which you know was exactly what we wanted for standing around in 30 F (before windchill) weather.   The cheesesteak ($7.50? Really?) was utter garbage, and this from someone who's only had a cheesesteak twice before: once from the cart in front of the Liberty Bell Center, and another from some random fast food joint in California the week I found out we were moving to Philly. It's been almost a full 24 hours since I ate the thing (because after taking a few bites neither the boyfriend nor our visiting friend wanted anything to do with it, and I hate to waste food, or in this case, ""food""), and I still feel the bread and cheese pressing down on my appendix.  Half way through abandoning me to my last meal on earth, the assholes decided they wanted to try Pat's instead. I was like, sure, if you help me finish this we can get a cheesesteak from Pat's.

Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star.   In the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two.   From the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz.  The combination works well and IMO that is why they're here.

Definitely overrated, although better than Pat's.  My comparison review:   My comparison review of Genos v. Pats: Despite their poor reviews on Yelp for being over priced, less than spectacular, and staffed by greasy men with the unique streak of arrogance borne of notoriety, we felt that experiencing the origins of the 'steak would be more rewarding than tracking down steakeries more highly regarded by the on-line community.   So off to South Philly we ventured. We had been warned by other steak hunters that the area inhabited by the legendary steakeries was dilapidated and dangerous- so we were happily surprised to find them located in a vibrant community reminiscent of the San Francisco Mission (except with a lot less Latinos and a lot more Italians.)   Arriving unmolested, we broke into teams to procure steaks from each of the shops (without out having to stand in both the long winding lines sequentially.) Our team went to Geno's, while Priscilla, Tammy and Sam went to Pat's to pick up our steaks.  Geno's was interestingly decorated in photo's of the owner and his son posing with scantily-clad, skanky looking women and various celebs, as well as over the top pro-American propaganda and anti-immigrant rhetoric.   I was warned by a woman in line that I must order our steaks with the whiz. Apparently it caused quite an uproar when John Kerry failed to order the traditional ""South Philly,"" from Geno's- note that Pat's doesn't serve the whiz, so apparently the style only represents the north corner of the intersection, rather than all of South Philly.  When I returned to our seats, team 2 had already procured our steaks from Pats. Apparently some confusion had occurred during ordering, and we now had in our possession 7 steaks- 4 from Pats, and 3 from Genos.   Both steaks were pretty basic- thin strips of steak with onions on bland French rolls; Pat's came with the traditional Provolone and Geno's with the aforementioned Cheese Whiz.  I started by eating one half of a Pat's steak. It was decent, but uninspiring. Several members of the expedition complained that Pat's Steaks were too dry. While not overly moist, I didn't share their concern; however the flavor was lacking in my opinion. Pat's Steaks were very bland in flavor, reminding me of my own creations before I got down with Montreal seasoning and fresh garlic. The cheese was also lacking in flavor.   Next, I moved onto a Geno's steak, with the Whiz. I was intrigued by the flavor and consistency of the Whiz; the steak was juicier than Pat's and the Whiz and grease mixed into thin cheese-gravy that soaked the otherwise bland roll. The meat was similarly bland to that of Pat's, but the flavor of the Whiz compensated for the most part.   I ended up consuming about 2.5-3 steaks in various portions in the sitting, as a excess had been ordered and various members of the expedition were unable to complete their missions, so I feel that I am qualified to end the age old debate as to who makes the best Cheese Steak:  Consensus amongst the group was that Geno's made the better steak of the two, but Geno's lost points due to the quasi-racist vibe, and at least 1 member of the expedition didn't care much for the Whiz. If we had spent more than a single night in Philly, we would have undoubtedly searched for less famous, but more delectable competition, but unfortunately we left the City of Brotherly love disappointed by the over-hyped, over-rated 'steaks.   Mike's Ratings: (On a scale from 1-5, 5 being perfect and 1 being inedible.)  Cheese Steak Shop: 4.5-5 (Great tasting, but pretty expensive.

With that said, you should definitely try both them and Pat's just to see what you like.  My wife and I split one at each.  Geno's was fine, but we preferred the bread better at Pat's.  If you're a tourist, I don't see having to pick one place, unless maybe you are a midget traveling solo.  We got there at 10AM on a Sunday morning in December and there was no line.  Sat down for 10 minutes in our jackets and enjoyed the heck out of out sandwich, then crossed the street and did the same at Pat's.  This would be my recommendation.  Unlike some, we will not hold Geno's accountable for the 18 degree weather, I'm thinking this is out of their control.  Also, a lot of comments are critical of the cash only.  This isn't Peter Luger's, my wife and I spent $10, maybe you get two so now you're up to $20 - you don't have $20?  If so, there may be bigger issues here than Geno's perfectly clear cash policy.  Unlike some, we didn't find the staff rude.  My wife and I completely New York'ed our order, just told them what we wanted and left out the wit' or wit' out wording.  The ordering instructions are pretty clear, we messed up, but we still got our sandwich with no attitude.  And even if there is a slight attitude folks, it's not like you're asking about the nose on a '04 cab, it's an order window.  And one more thing, just to address a fellow Yelper's comment - ""Next, no indoor seating or covered seating"".  Do they advertise indoor seating?  Do you research before you go?  How is this Geno's fault?  Also, there is a giant awning covering a number of the outdoor tables, look at any picture.  Were you maybe at some-sort of Phily cheesesteak cart?  Did you not look up?  You want to knock the food, even though most of us are not food critics, Yelp gives us the avenue to do that.  But what's annoying is when things that the Yelper clearly screwed up are being held against the establishment.    Even though we preferred the cheesesteak better at Pat's, as someone that works at the World Trade Center, I respect the 9/11 patch they had on the outside of the place.  There is an intense rivalry between New York and Philly when it comes to sports, it's cool to see that when all that bullshit ends, we're on the same team.

When it IS hot, I must say it's a tasty sandwich, even though it seems like it's mass-produced, like McDonalds or Burger King. It also seems the sandwiches are a bit smaller than they used to be. What, are they trying to cut costs or something?  At $7.50 per cheesesteak...this place is a CASH COW!  Joey Vento is a very rich man, no doubt! His plainly visible political views are entertaining, if nothing else. I do like the support of Daniel Faulkner, among other things. And lastly, beware of the hot sauce!  I am fully convinced this stuff is radioactive, and is made in a nuclear-fueled spice engine. It's so hot, that every time I go there I just have to put a penny-sized drop on my sandwich, just to remind myself of how insanely hot it really is!  So - Geno's is not the worst place you can get a cheesesteak, but you can certainly do better (and that doesn't mean cross the street)!",2,"nqHmFx837BIlsYNX5LsR4w"

I've had better steak sandwiches at my local hangout in Florida - maybe even at Subway. Seriously. There was barely any meat and my boyfriend noticed only a sliver of provolone. The sandwich photo is extremely flattering.   We were really looking forward to this allegedly epic cheesesteak battle so I'll also post what I thought about the competition.   Pats was a bit better and I surprisingly liked the Whiz. Or maybe I was still trying to wash down the tough Genos steak. Pats meat was slightly juicier but neither sandwich was worth the $10 charge. These places are clearly made for post drinking stops where all you want is greasy food to sop up the booze. Otherwise they are simply tourist traps.

But if you're looking for nice cuts of sliced steak in your true Philly Cheesesteak ('whiz wit', and some added grilled mushrooms), then this is a must-see/must-eat.  A little about me, I love Philadelphia. There aren't many big cities I can say that about, but I've loved this city since my first visit back in '03. At the time, I was just jumping on board with what would be my NFL team for the last 15 years, the champion Philadelphia Eagles. But I'd been so busy with work the last couple times I came up that I never got a chance to really explore the city. So I finally got a day and I knew the first place I needed to visit was the ""Eagles Nest"". Unfortunately, there was a Phillies game going on, so I couldn't even get close to the stadium. So I went to my number two spot: the corner of 9th & Passyunk.  Now I had a choice to make: Pat's or Geno's. For me, the choice was easy, but only because I'd known about Geno's for such a long time and still hadn't been. (Pat's will get my dollars next time. I've already had Tony Luke's, and after this visit to Geno's I prefer sliced steak over chopped, but still have to try Pat's.)   Service here is incredibly fast... I don't think I waited more than a couple minutes before my food was ready to go. A seat opened up, I took my obligatory foodie pic, and got down to business. SO. MUCH. CHEESE. I loved it! Inhaling that greasy food was all I could do. I debated ordering another but I had to think about my arteries and the fact that I'm getting older.  Is this place a tourist trap? Yes. And I've seen some reviews bashing on the place. But the only thing I could really say was a let down were the employees attitudes. Still, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because I know the hours here are crazy, so I'm sure they're just ready to finish up and get some sleep.  (PERSONAL NOTE: A good friend of mine had visited this place only a month before, and I was going to FaceTime him while I was scarfing down my food to say, ""Yo! Guess where I'm at!""

The reviews don't lie and the sampling I had was awesome! I loved every bite of my cheesesteak. As did my family. This is NOT your typical cheesesteak. BOTH in size AND flavor. Even the fries were perfect. This beats the cheesesteaks I've had in NYC.   Note: tempted to have bought a cheesesteak from Pat's, King of the Cheesesteaks, across the street just to compare but the smell coming from this kitchen was the draw. The lines as well was indicative of the cult following this place has. While both places boast they are the best but there is only one that could be the original. Pat's was open first no argument there. So I'd be curious to see what others say about Pat's.   Back to Geno's,  all three cheesesteaks were delicious. Moist steak, just the right amount of cheese or whiz and the peppers on mine were spot on. They were juicy, tender, fully stuffed, a nice sizable portion per sandwich. Check out the pics!  This cheesesteak sandwich was longer than my kids' head. Lol. He enjoyed his immensely.   Here's the tip on how to order like a regular: one whiz with - means one cheesesteak with cheese whiz and onions. One American/Provolone without -  means one cheesesteak with ""cheese"" choice you mentioned without onions. This way made the ordering faster and efficient.   Since you are also ordering from separate windows, one line for steaks and the next window for fries and drinks, you don't have to be on one line. Although most people order both so that's why the lines get long. But it moves fast. The kitchen area is huge. At a given time, I saw at least three guys at the grill.   The cheesesteak is what makes Philly popular on the food map. Must try Geno's and get your fix. This was the best.",4,"C_SXjo805ECOlzQNLJBmCg"

I walked from Chinatown to Pat's and Geno's hungry with aching feet and got in not one, not two, but three lines (I'll explain). First off note that both locations take cash only, and that you probably will not be able to get a table. We got our Philly cheese steaks with onions and whiz, since I was under the impression that was what a true Philly cheese steak was. We decided on Pat's first due to the fact that the line appeared to be shorter and moving faster (haha shorter). It took about thirty minutes to get through the line, and we were ready having observed the sign that said to have our order and cash ready, so we step up to the first window and order our Pat's Philly and realize there is another separate line for ordering soda's and fries, which I promptly ran to while my boyfriend waited for the sandwich, two lines 30 minutes.   We walked a crossed the street and ate our sandwich on the street like animals. My first thought upon eating the cheese steak was I've made a better one at home. The meat lacked any flavor and I felt there wasn't enough whiz (which is strange since whiz actually makes me very sick...taking it for the yelp team today though).   So now, not hungry, and realizing we stopped making these at home because whiz makes me sick, we stumble a crossed the street to Geno's and for consistency's sake ordered the same sub after waiting another 20 minutes in line. Geno's cooking area is open to the public, as we waited we watched the workers make the subs in a surprisingly clean kitchen. They cranked them out. When ordering we did note the Geno's guy said thanks, and he seemed in a better mood. Geno's meat as most people noted is sliced, rather than shredded, which I did think made it taster. Though it was gawdy as all get out, Geno's in my opinion produced a better sub. The bread at both seemed the same, though my boyfriend thought Pat's bread was better less bready. I also felt Geno's was a better cheese to meat ratio, cheesier, and the meat tasted as if it was seasoned or just a better quality of meat.

Why? To put the ages-old debate between Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's Steaks to rest once and for all... Not that the debate will ever really die...  We ended up hitting Pat's first, then trekking all over the city, only to return to Geno's before heading home.  Gotta work off the calories, yanno!  In the end we all came to pretty much the same conclusion. Overall Pat's really is the King of Steaks. Geno's decor was overwhelming and gaudy. We did not find the giant picture of a cheesesteak surrounded by flashing neon lights on the roof to be particularly endearing and certainly did not add to the flavor of the sandwiches. The bright neon orange slathered all over every possible paintable surface did not help, either. I greatly preferred and appreciated the understated and unassuming simplicity of the decor (or lack thereof) that we found at Pat's. They still had what looked like the original Pepsi sign with their name. We were also taunted by a 10 year old walking by with a Geno's cup while we were minding our own business, sitting on the curb eating our steaks.  None of us appreciated the blatant politics of Geno's either. For those unaware of the controversy, a few years ago Geno's was sued for having a sign on their window that said ""This is America, Speak English when ordering!!""... While I acknowledge their right to have whatever signs broadcasting whatever politics to which they ascribe, I find the hypocrisy of their Italian heritage coupled with their obvious prejudices to be quite distasteful.  On to the actual food.  The rolls from both place were exactly the same. More bread than meat - first bite: all bread. The onions at Pat's were actually fried, with that caramelized color and flavor I like in my onions (when on a cheesesteak, that is). Geno's onions seemed to have been lightly fried, more from incidental contact. They were still so crunchy that they were almost fresh. Not that I mind fresh onions, but fried onions aren't supposed to have that fresh-onion zing. They're supposed to be fried.  The cheese. I could barely taste the cheese at Geno's. I opted for provolone, while my companions opted for the orange cheese-snot product called Cheez-Whiz. Pat's was generous with their provolone and the steak was hot enough to actually melt it before I was able to sink my teeth into it. Initially my companions did complain about the Whiz oozing out of the sandwich and onto the paper, but after eating at Geno's they realized that having enough Whiz to *taste*, much less have ooze out of the sandwich was a blessing, not a curse.  Finally, the steak. This is the one point that we did have to give to Geno's. Pat's steak was shredded, more or less, which is really the way every cheesesteak I've had is. I have no complaints at all about shredded steak, however Geno's steak was sliced, so it actually maintained the classic ""steak"" texture, more reminiscent of roast beef than typical cheesesteak. This is really more about the style of cheesesteak than the quality. Though Geno's sliced style was a bit tastier, it wasn't what I think of when I think of a true Philly Cheesesteak.  All in all I prefer the cheesesteak experience I found at Pat's King of Steaks. The fries were delicious (though I didn't try the fries at Geno's, I suspect they're about the same), the line moved faster, the onions weren't overwhelming, but just added to the sandwich, the cheese was tastier and meltier, and the whole experienced oozed real, authentic Philadelphia culture. If you want a taste of what Philadelphia really is all about, I'd recommend Pat's King of Steaks.",1,"1TkKWOV_pEwtbbLi6UrU8w"

Never got past the signs in the windows of Geno's before eating at Pat's.  The ""This is America.  Order in English"" signs are still there.  Ick!  I understand the anti-immigrant bigotry behind the signs.  But this is Philadelphia, PA.  We should be better than Arizona.  I know that the beloved founder, Joey Vento, was famous for those signs.  I'm sure he was the son or grandson of Italian immigrants.  I asked the counter person if his ancestors stepped right off the boat in the U.S. already speaking the King's English.  She just shrugged.  I assume Vento would have approved of restaurants and stores refusing to serve his parents or grandparents before they learned English.  We should be encouraging foreign tourism in the U.S. We should be trying to make them feel welcome in Philadelphia.  This does not cast our country or city in a good light to tourists.  My wife and I are fortunate to travel throughout the world.  We bring phrase books.  But for the most part we rely on the kindness and undrstanding (and English) of natives of those foreign countries to help us order food.  Not so at Geno's.  It just makes you want to take a shower after seeing such a truly racist and ignorant sign.  There are many possible reasons that someone does not speak English.  It doesn't just mean that someone isn't trying to learn or is an ""illegal alien.""  How about a smile and at least trying to help instead of a nasty sign?",3,"ND2dBckgVv9qGA0te2Qcmw"

So disappointed to have finally got to Philly and get over to Geno's or Pat's...try it and be utterly underwhelmed. Should have asked locals where to go rather than be drawn in to the ""famous"" places.  I grew up in Venice, CA and we have a little hoagie shop there that claims to be just like Philly's..now I can compare and say I will stick with Venice's version.   Geno's obviously has high turnover and they care very little about quality versus rushing a sandwich out the window. I ordered a steak sandwich with provolone, onions, mushrooms and peppers. In under 2 minutes our sandwich was handed to us. In Venice, you have a good 10 minute wait as it is made fresh FOR YOU! The steak is cooked as you order with the cheese melted on top. The onions and peppers and mushrooms freshly grilled to order. This means the meat is not rubbery and dry because it was cooked long ago. The cheese is actually melted into the meat and nice and hot because it was JUST cooked. This provolone was barely noticable and partially melted because it had warm already cooked meat thrown on top of that. No flavor to the onions, peppers and mushrooms that were a bit undercooked probably in large quantities and set aside for hours.  The bread was too much..a chewy sourdough like roll rather than a french style which yes would get soggy but you eat it fast enough when it is fresh and hot.  Also, like other patrons..turned off by the ""It's America, order in english"". Whoever owns (ed) Geno's surely had relatives who came from another country speaking another language. This is a melting pot..why such hate? Just such a negative thing to post up...racist attitude prevails in neighborhood or just a racist owner??   The whole experience....MEH!!!! Keep your cheesesteaks..I will just enjoy them in Venice when I go there.

Lets start with a cheesesteak being a very simple sandwich with basic ingredients. How you put the pieces together largely determines the outcome. Geno's has a very good product and we are lucky to have so many steak choices in Philly.

I asked if she could cut it in four pieces, she scoffed and said absolutely not and that she shouldn't be cutting it at all for me... wtf?   I'm not sure what the hell that means.

Having said that, there is no compelling reason to ever eat here.  Let's start at the foundation. The thick bread is less memorable than muzak--just another mildly-stale tube of simple carbs to gunk up your mouth. The fillings, such as they are, impress even less: five pieces of concrete-colored steak with the texture of a mouse pad, a few sweaty squares of onion, and a watery trail of synthetic cheese lube. This would have been more of a textural nightmare if the scant portions hadn't been completely overwhelmed by the cloud of bread.  Strangely, the ensemble needed salt, which might have helped the steak taste less like dirty water. Insufficient salt, you stammer incredulously? Insufficient salt at a dive restaurant that depends on the dollars of airheaded tourists like Ray L?  Friends, I speak the truth.  To the best of my knowledge this has never happened before. Anywhere. Bad restaurants always over-salt... making Geno's is unique in at least one regard.  We probably don't need to waste time discussing the price. Actually, I take that back: a sandwich this bad should come wrapped up in $20s to console the hapless diner. The actual $9 price tag is egregious.

But because I live on the West Coast I was never able to really see what's all the fuss is about. After researching the place for quite some time I arrived in the early afternoon pretty hungry. The line wasn't too long of a wait which was surprising but I'm not complaining.  First thing I did was try out my accent in attempting to order a Whiz Wit. For those who don't know what that is that is steak with cheese whiz and onions. I knew I was a rookie in doing this but the cashier let me slide as I got my cheesesteak and headed off to get a drink and cheese fries.  Even though that I read that this place doesn't get the best reviews, I decided to come here with an open mind and not much of an expectation due to the fact that I didn't want to be let down like a lot of the previous reviewers. In my opinion it's actually quite ridiculous to have such high expectations for a place, and to rate a place horribly just because your experience is not what you expected. I do know for a fact that the service was very friendly and very efficient in what they do.  Now enough blabbering and onto the food. Naturally I wanted to try Geno's first simply because I heard Pat's was the originator so I wanted to save that for last. The only problem I had with their food is that the cheese fries tasted a little soggy and bland and felt like it was premade and sat around for a little while. The steak itself was great, changing things up for a change using whole slices of beef rather than cutting it up along with the fact that the meat itself was nicely seasoned. The bread was nice and fresh and everything was wrapped in a tidy way to prevent a mess of all the juices to go around.

I base my rating ONLY on the taste of steak that has been pared down to it's most essential of elements: Bread, Steak and Provolone Cheese (I can't do artificial cheese, sorry folks).  I only go when I'm starving, and I usually eat half in my car and half at home.  Today I got that hunger pang, and to Geno's I went.  Geno's steak is a mediocre steak.  Edible, but mediocre.  Don't get me wrong, the establishment has a glitzy facade, and a cheesesteak turf war that is unrivaled ... but the steak itself is just average.  The  construction of the steak is sliced meat on top of sliced provolone on a bun.  The steak was good, but not spectacular.  I can forgive having cheese that's not melted throughout when you're working with steak slices, but I do like when the meat is hot enough to melt the cheese.  This was not the case with my steak.  And the bread was okay ... but not incredible either.  The mediocrity remained after the steak cooled off.  Tony Luke's is still killing it, so far.  Despite that, I will say that in my opinion, Geno's is a better steak than Pat's for 3 reasons:   #1 No gristle in the meat (if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that's a dealbreaker for me). #2 It was not ridiculously greasy like Pat's steak was. #3 At 8.50, it was a bigger steak than Pat's provides at the same price.

They don't chop up the steak, it had no flavor. My husband asked for hot peppers, u have to get it yourself instead of them dressing up the sandwich for you. I asked them for a travel sub to take the sandwich back home. Most places will strategically prep and wrap the ingredients of the sub in such a way so that when u get home, you can put all the ingredients together (bread, meat, toppings) and it'll be fresh just as when you ordered it...without it being all soggy. Nope they don't do that.

I'm embarrassed to even say this is an ""authentic"" cheesesteak from philly. I've had them and it's nothing like this trash. It's like they're so concerned with getting as many orders as they can, they don't really pay attention to what the customer wants. Your sandwich is ready by the time you finsh paying. They're faster than your local fast food restaurant.  This tells me there's nothing to the sandwich if they're able to hand them out like that. An authentic place you should wait at least 10 to 15 min for them to cook, chop up, and prep toppings to order. I seem to want to believe the only reason that they're popular is because people like the fact that it's in competition with Pat's across the street and want to make there own comparison.  And because of this, both establishments probably keep each other afloat. I won't be back. For a real cheesesteak try out Paganos on Ogontz Ave in Philly or Diconstanzas in Chichester, Pa.",2,"yCu9YTYU_MgfCzUaW7n3jA"

The great cheesesteak debate over which one is better, Gino's or Pats in South Philly has been raging for years. Ever since I first saw these two places featured, well, on just about every travel and food network I can think of, I always wanted to visit south Philadelphia to find out for myself. These places seemed to have so much character, and the cheesesteaks did look awesome.  We were on the eve, literally, of opening up Jim's Bar and BBQ the following week when Ruthie said to me, ""Jim, if people find out about your BBQ, you are not going to have a weekend off for a very long time. Between editing Jim Baugh Outdoors, writing the second book  ""COOKED"" and running a Bar and BBQ six days a week, this might be a good time to get out of town for the weekend. Could be our last chance for a very long time.""  We arrived at Pats at around five o clock. I was at first surprised to see how close Pats and Gino's was. They almost mirror each other, each one just across the street from each other.  We stood where Sylvester Stallone stood in the movie Rocky and began to figure out how to order our first cheese steak. We had been warned.... that you better have you order ready when you get to the window, or it could be trouble.  Ruthie and I had a plan, we would order the same basic sandwich from each place, and spit each one and decided for ourselves which was better.  As we found out, there is no looser here. Both where fantastic, however there was some clear differences, that may just end up being up to personal preference. In other words, do you like your onions seen??? Or so small they blend into the sandwich and not even notice they are there. That sort of thing, both are good, just which one would someone prefer.  We ordered Pats first and Ruth almost bit my hand off, she was downing that thing fast, I could not get near it. It did look and taste fantastic. We ordered the standard, wiz, wit. Meaning Cheese With and onions.  This Cheesesteak was really good. The meat seemed to be both chopped and also sliced. We gave it a 10, thought it was great, and also loved the way Pats had a bin of all fresh peppers. You could really make one awesome sandwich here, however we wanted to keep it simple for comparison, just the basics.   Next, we happily walk across the street to Gino's. All the celeb pictures pasted all over the place was really fun. Once again we ordered without any problems, found a seat, and dug in.  We both thought right from the start at Gino's, there was a marked difference between the two cheese steaks.  Gino's sub roll was better. It was softer, hotter, and had more flavor. I do know a little something about bread baking, and even have two sourdough starters in my fridge. Gino's sub roll was better for sure.  Next, the meat. Gino's was better, seemed to have more flavor. It was all sliced cuts of meat, and this may have been the difference.  Next, the onions, WAY better at Gino's. They were cooked perfect, tender, and you could actually bite into one. VERY good.  As far as the cheese wiz, no secret there, both Pats and Gino's offer the ""Wiz"" and for this sandwich I highly recommend doing the wiz.  So, for Ruthie and I, we voted hands down Gino's for the best Philly cheese steak. No doubt both are fantastic.  If you go, do what we did. Go to one, and then the other, everybody join in and decide for yourself which one you like best. If you ever go near Philadelphia, don't miss going to Pats and Gino's. These places are legendary and it is quite a treat to go there and experience there ambiance, and of course, world class Philly cheesesteaks.  While we were happy to give Gino's our number one spot in our little taste tester, we of course were sad and of course disappointed to hear that Joey Vento passed away only two weeks prior to our trip. We had really looked forward to meeting him and am sure he will be truly missed by his legions of fans worldwide.  RIP Joey Vento.",1,"tOp5-dOJHkshNdf312FRkg"

Geno's is an aesthetic embarassment.  while Pat's scores points with an understated and humble exterior, Geno's has always tried to compensate for their inferior product by dressing the whole place up in a vomit-inducing sea of neon lights.  take a note, Geno:  the lights only illuminate your desperation.  2.  the menu -- Geno's is the only place I have ever heard of (outside of the cafeteria in our fair halls of congress, that is)  that ever replaced their ""french fries"" with ""freedom fries"".  that's right.  they call them freedom fries.   yeeee-ikes.  3.  the xenophobia -- Notoriously opposed to the post-italian immigrants in south philly, and probably pissed at the five or six french tourists who visit philadelphia a year, the window at Geno's features a delightful little sign which states ""this is AMERICA please speak ENGLISH when ordering"" followed by a sign stating ""Management Reserves the Right to Refuse Service"".  and if you think the message in sign 1 has never intersected with the policy in sign 2, think again.  what a fine ambassador to our city you are, Genie-boy!  4.  the plaque -- underneath the window is a plaque hung in honor of fallen police officer Daniel Faulkner.  for non-delphians, this name might not mean much, but he is the victim in our city's highest-profile and most hot-button murder case.  (i won't go into the details, but if you want to know more about what this is all about, you'll find plenty of info when you google ""Mumia"".)  my issue is not that they honor the memory of this police officer, which i think is perfectly appropriate if done respectfully.  what seems kind of messed up is the fact that the plaque gives equal time to the officer's accused murderer:    it just seems really inappropriate, and i can't imagine it would make any friends or family of officer faulkner feel very good if they have to be reminded of the murderer's name every time they see the plaque.  i don't mean to focus too heavily on this cheesesteakery's politics, but  in being so flagrant about it they clearly invite the scrutiny.  the bottom line is this:  Pat's is just a better steak, and if it's too hard for you to make up your mind based on the variables of taste, texture, size, and service... there are plenty of other factors you can use to justify your decision.  Perhaps the sign on Pat's window says it best --- ""Don't eat a Mis-steak""",2,"xgb7eAAvodR9P-KxDsHc6A"

They may not sell the best cheesesteaks & may only have the name going for them but this is a good place to start.  You can't try one without trying the other.  I enjoy the sandwiches at both but they are very different.  Don't expect friendliness when placing your order; no time to chatter because the lines are long.  At Geno's you'll bite into slices of sirloin, the bread is soft & probably the sandwich is a little drier than at Pat's.  Pat's chops its meat a bit more & gets a little more of the juice from the meat into the sandwich.  Bread is really soft too.

First I'll discuss THAT...then the food.  Geno's is notorious because a short while ago owner Joey Vento posted up signs that said he would refuse to provide service to people who ordered in any language other than English. It said """"This is America. When ordering please speak English.""   A discrimination complaint was filed with the city of Philadelphia and Vento defended his racist, discriminatory policy in court. He claims he has a problem with the current immigration situation in the United States, and that his sign was an issue of free speech. He's right, of course; he can SAY whatever he wants as long as he doesn't actually deny customers because they speak a foreign language, or treat them badly because of it.  However his sign belies a deeper problem: Joey Vento believes that if your first language is anything other than English, you aren't an ""American."" He believes that real Americans speak English. This is both ignorant and false, and coming from the son of Italian immigrants it makes it doubly offensive.  Vento is PROUD of his racist hate message. He distributes pens from that say ""Proud to be an American""; next to this is a photo of him smiling and pointing at a sign that says ""Management reserves the right to refuse service.""  Guess what, Mr. Vento? That old chestnut ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason...""? It's an old wives' tale. There are lots of reasons why it is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL to refuse service to someone, and their race is one of them - along with gender, religion, political view and many more.  There are plenty of reasons not to eat at Geno's Steaks in Philadelphia; another good reason is that the food tastes like horsecrap. It is truly a tourist cesspool that draws people in with big neon signs; I live three blocks away and frequently I have to detour around another block when going out to run errands because the line at Geno's runs around the corner.  The bottom line is, if you eat at Geno's, in addition to getting food that tastes like it was crapped onto a plate for your enjoyment, you are also supporting a filthy racist bigot.",8,"jK_SY5ciS1IL82Cf3Ed1_w"

The onion topping is great, and the option to get birch beer is a great touch.  The steaks are easily the smallest among the Big Three, but the taste is still excellent.  I prefer ""Provy wit"" (provolone cheese with onions), which isn't the classic Philadelphia style, but I did try the ""Whiz wit"" today, and I thought it was a unique taste. Very flavorful, but the taste of Whiz just isn't my thing.  The fries are quite good, but nothing really special.  Now, for the attitude. They strongly support the Philadelphia police force, which I obviously have no problem with.  But they do it to a point where it's just invasive of the friendly eating environment that I prefer.  Also, they feel very strongly that everyone in America should speak English all the time, as supported by their semi-famous ""Speak English"" campaign, complete with t-shirts.  This is typical American egotism and it outrages me. I feel like a lot of the blue-collar heart of Philadelphia shares this attitude and it makes me glad I left.  If you look at a photo that I uploaded, you will see a hilariously ironic message on the owner's vehicle, which reads as follows:      Joey Vento say's [sic] this is America! ""Speak English""  Hey Joey, maybe you should go ahead and learn English before you start pushing it on people who haven't been surrounded by it since the day they were born.",5,"mYO_f9LkEybqZV3SUCKcLg"

It's like Giordano's versus Lou Malnati's for Chicago-style pizza -- both might be great, but you have to pick a favorite.  For me, I'm going with Geno's because they focus more on the meat rather than the Cheese Whiz.  I'm also going to say the use of the whiz for philly cheese steaks has got to be the most overrated culinary concept of all time (dodges lightning bolt).    I think the attitude at Geno's and Pat's further accentuates life in South Philly.  It's not only about the sandwiches, but there is also a distinct Philly flair to the service which makes this place great.   And now time for my little moment on the soapbox.  If a restaurant requests their patrons to speak English to them, that is their right.  After all, freedom of speech includes the right to state beliefs or ideas that might be construed as offensive (by the way, English is not my first language).

The sweet onions and the provolone were a nice compliment. I was surprised the sandwiches didn't have a lot more meat. I've been other places where the beef is falling out of the bun and the cheese is slathered all over it, great big globs of gooey, yummy grease. This was not that. But it was still tasty. I just expected more and messier.   All in all, I'm glad I went. Yeah there was some of that ""freedom fry"" signage on the walls that I think is silly, but they also support the police, military and fire fighters.

The meat at Pat's was a little jucier but more fatty.  Neither had a real good steak taste though.  I got whiz on the Pat's sandwich which gave it a creamy texture, although they were pretty skimpy with it so there wasn't nearly enough whiz. My husband got provolone on the Geno's sandwich and it wasn't even melted.  All in all, I wouldn't go to either place again.  Our tour guide pointed us towards Sonny's which is on Market street (3-4 blocks from the Liberty Bell so wat more convenient). It was also cheaper and way tastier.  But if you are like me and have to go just to go, I recommend Pat's over Geno's.",1,"rgF7tkl68nE_H9LDxu9kiw"

Years ago when I was an airline employee I commuted between Minneapolis and Philadelphia every Friday night.   Those were those days when airline employees traveled first class.  So I started asking my fellow passengers Geno's or Pat's.   It was always fun as everyone had an opinion.  Once a fight almost broke out. First off Geno's was not on the scene until 1966.  Pat's was the first and was the one that invited the Philly Cheese Steak back in 1930.   So Geno's in NOT the original. At both places parking is hard (the are across the street from each other).   Neither place has a parking lot.  Both places have a few tables outside.  You have to jump in quick when one opens up.  Geno's does have a stand up area.  Even in the dead of winter it's eat outside or in your car.  Both places are open 24 hours a day and every day except Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Both have two windows, one for the steak and the other for fries and sodas.  You order twice and pay twice. The big difference between the two is the way the meat is prepared.  Geno's does not chop up the meat on the grill.   You get the steak in whole slices.  The onions at Geno's are also less grilled, they are between raw and grilled.  Pat's the onions are grilled. Both places you order Wiz Wit or Wiz Without.  That mean with cheese wiz and with or without onions.   Always order it with wiz.  I know it sounds gross.  Who eats that goopey, neon orange cheese?  I would not touch it on anything else, but on a cheese steak it's great.   I have tried it with provolone and it's way too dry. Some people say the bread is different between the two. If that is true it's way too subtle for me to detect.    Of the two I prefer the Pat's cheese steak better.   On a side note, Geno's serves up a little politics with it's steaks.  They do not allow you to order in anything other than English.  (When is Wiz Wit English?) They also have a lot of articles about immigration and call their fries ""Freedom Fries"", not French Fries.

Thank a vet for that right by the way and rest in peace Joey Vento!  OK, so now that the terrorists and europeans are all offended, lets get on to the purpose of this review, the cheese steak.  As many of you know, Geno's and Pats have been bashing each others brains in on 9th and Wharton for many years.  Both have claims to fame.  So it comes down to the whole Ford Vs. Chevy debate...........which do you prefer??  The only way to figure it out is to have one from each joint.  As a famous Bose commercial once stated....we don't make the music, we just make it sound better.  Well, Pat may have invented the cheese steak but Genos makes it better!  Here's why i like Genos better.  First, the Amoroso roll.  Slightly crunchy. Second, the steak.  Not chopped in a million pieces.  Real thin slices.  Better flavor content and fat distribution in the steak.  When you chop it up like Pats you can get a whole mouthful of fat chunks.  No thanks.  By the way, when you eat a steak at home, do you slice it or grind it up like coffee grounds??  Exactly.  Now that's the base of the sandwich.  This is where there are 8 million different variations.  If you want a true Philly steak, order it ""wit"" onions and whiz.  That's right.  Cheese whiz.  I myself was an onions and provolone guy for years until I met Joey.  He asked me if i ever had it with whiz.  Guess what?  I will never have it with anything else since Ive had whiz!  I wont rate Pat's because its not bad.  Genos is just way better.  Plus its in a way better neighborhood than Pats!  LOL!!! (they are across the street from each other)",1,"zZGUzFmi891_N-tzh3mHJw"

You can get a better cheesesteak, plus a can of soda and chips, for $5 from any street vendor, while Geno's charges $7 for just the sandwich.  Plus, there is very little meat on the sandwich and it is not that flavorful.   Price and mediocrity aside, the owner is obviously a major jerk.  ""Order in English"" signs are all over the place, and he actually sells T-shirts that say it, too.  Now, keep in mind that Geno's is a MAJOR tourist attraction.  Tour buses routinely stop there because it is such a legendary place (don't ask me why.)  Many of these tourists are visiting from other countries and probably do not speak English very well, if at all.  Anyone who goes out of his way to make a major portion of his customer base feel unwelcome certainly does not deserve to be patronized and raised to iconic status, especially when his food sucks.  Finally, I agree that those who immigrate to this country should learn to speak English.  However, I am also aware that learning a new language, especially a difficult one like English, takes a bit of time.  I am sure that even the great Joe Vento's parents took at least a year to become reasonably conversant.     If he seriously wanted people to learn to speak English, he would take down the ""order in English"" signs and instead post signs advertising the local English language instruction center - you know, signs that actually inform people where to go to learn English instead of simply demanding that they do so.",0,"FYvkTZSicN8hHN0v8Ks9iw"

I tried both in a row, and there were a few things about Geno's that I was wary of from the start. They had signs posted everywhere saying ""English only,"" which was completely unnecessary and just rude. There was another sign around Geno's tables (can't remember the exact language) basically stating that only Geno's customers may sit down. In my opinion, there was no need for them to go to such lengths since Pat's was right across the way and had neither of those signs, even knowing that most people stop by to try both.  The cheesesteak - not worth the time I spent waiting in line. The bread was correct (Philly bread that was so soft w/o falling apart), but the meat, which Geno's brags is better quality, was very chewy and had been fried in long strips. This means that when you bite into it, your teeth won't always cut the chewy meat properly, and you will end up dragging out a large piece of meat. I much preferred the meat at Pat's where they chop up the meat into small pieces and fry with oil. I asked for fried onions with mine, and it was standard (nothing special or different from what they served at Pat's). I felt like they may have given me less slices of cheese, but I didn't count it, so I can't be sure. It could also easily be that the chopped up pieces of meat from Pat's just melted and absorbed the cheese better than the long strips of meat from Geno's did.   Overall, I think Pat's just packs a bit more flavor and a better texture.

First of all, Genos staff is nicer, they are more tolerant of hessitant customers, confused peeps or anyone with a couple of Qs.  Usually has a shorter line than Pats so u will get ur food faster.  Just like Pats, ur cheese steak will b ready in a mere seconds after u order.  Menus are basically identically 2 Pats.  price is also nearly the same.    When it comes down to the cheese steak itself, it is very good.  It just falls a lil short of the taste of Pats.  Pats and Genos seems 2 b like the Lan EVO vs WRX STI, EVO is generally accepted as a lil better but pretty close.  i dont know why im comparing cheese steaks with rally cars, it just seemed like a very accurate if not odd metaphor.  If any of yall think otherwise, let me know.    In conclusion, i also think Genos avg score is 2 low.  It is very good in its own right, but got tuff competion on the other side of the street.

Of course there was the controversy over the sign posted a couple of years ago requiring customers to order in English and there was a lot of back and forth about this being offensive, possibly discriminatory or a violation of the owner's right to free speech (if only the general public really understood what the right to free speech meant, ugh). Anyway, the owner of Geno's (Joe Vento) led a recent trip with a tour company called Conservative Tours. The company is designed to appeal to more conservative minded folks (no real problem with that, but a little odd considering the group most likely consists of those who are white, correct me if I am wrong). Well this group recently visited Italy led by Joe Vento, owner of Geno's Steaks and the mastermind behind the sign mentioned above about ordering in English at his place of business. Well, word on the street is that Mr. Vento ordered his food in Italy in English or tried to. He had the help of an interpreter when English was not understood by whomever was taking his order. Mr. Vento was also handing out T-shirts to Italians and guests of his tour with his famous slogan about ordering in English. Is this guy that out of  touch that he believes that others should be required to place their orders in English at his establishment, but that he can visit another country (where English is not the native language) and that it's okay for him to not order in that country's language? Yes, he is completely out of touch, out of his mind and beyond hypocritical. Why do the words conservative and hypocrisy always seem to work so well together? Go to Pat's across the street. The steak is better anyway. Geno's may have more flash and more lights, but that is just another example of this man's extraordinary ego. I have always liked the idea that ""less is more"" plus I would not intentionally patronize an establishment owned by someone who would display such arrogance by demanding something of others that he could not produce himself. Imagine going to Italy wearing that t-shirt and then not even attempting to follow his own belief. Italians shouldn't have to take his order in English especially when they are not welcome to place their order in Italian at his restaurant. Oh, I forgot, it is the Mexicans (or those that speak Spanish) that he was really addressing with that sign. Discrimination and hypocrisy at its finest. Also, I heard the Italians laughed at the t-shirts and thought the guy was a total joke (and not the good kind).",0,"swVvuCuYa9miKgzm3c6vgw"

I went to undergrad in Philly so trust me, I speak cheesesteak. The locals will tell you (and I agree) that the best cheesesteak shops can be found tucked away in the neighborhoods. To be honest, in my entire four years of college, I never had reason to trek down to Pat's or Geno's. My husband, however, wanted to experience the whole blinking light, mano-a-mano rivalry between Geno's and Pat's. So on our way home after an amazing day trip in Philly, we stopped at Geno's. (We had done Pat's before, and while it wasn't the best I ever had, it was a solid cheesesteak.)  For a place that prides itself on being a Philly landmark, you'd think they'd cater to the tourist. Most locals and Philly foodies already avoid this place like the plague. However, Geno's wants the tourist to cater to them. You better learn the rules of ordering before you step to the counter or else you will be shunned. I get that part of the mystique of the place is the rudeness and the whole ""wit or wittout"" lingo, but it's not just a schtick with them. It's really how they are. Beware if you try ordering your fries and drinks from the cheesesteak window. They will yell at you for not knowing or assuming that the window at the far end of the building is where you get your fries and sodas.  Now let's talk about what Geno's calls a cheesesteak. They don't chop the meat. It's sliced thick and is very chewy and flavorless. The bread was stale and the fries were rather forgettable. If you find yourself torn Geno's and Pat's, I'd tell you to go across the street to Pat's. They have the better food, and their outdoor decor isn't as fussy and gimmicky as Geno's.  If you want the best of the best in Philly cheesesteaks, head down to Tony Luke's on Oregon Ave, or Jim's at 4th and South. I definitely can vouch for Jim's far superior cheesesteak. I spent many a late night and many a work study dollar at Jim's.  But back to Geno's. Skip it. Definitely not worth the trip or the hassle to find parking and seating.",4,"2rT4UIGcWLcwHSbIjihQDQ"

Also Geno's uses slabs of meat and it kinda reminds me of high school cafeteria food. On top of that, they had canned mushrooms, and they stand out in a gross way. I love mushrooms but these slimy things are a big let down at all Genos, Pats, and Jim's in Philly, Pat's used the least which was smart. Also the tables were just gross.

There's a million other places to get a cheesesteak in Philly and 99% of them are better. Most places also give you more/ better quality meat and way more of a variety like chicken, different cheeses (not everybody likes cheese wiz and provolone), and endless toppings (onions, cheese, and a pepper is all you'll get at Geno's). And it's the same with their fries. In my opinion, the only difference between these two places is the bread. Worst of all, there's no inside. So finding a place to eat outside can be hit or miss.

They said it was Johns Roast Pork so that's where we went. Johns is listed as #1 for Cheese steak in Philly even though their signature sandwich is a pork sandwich. All I can say about that is read my review on them and walk the other way. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. OH MY GOD IT WAS HORRIBLE. DO NOT GO THERE. GOD, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! GROSSNESS.  Anyway, we headed across town and since Genos and Pat Kings are literally 50 feet from each other we ordered a sandwich from each. IMPORTANT: CASH ONLY!  At Pat Kings we ordered a steak, onion and sharp provolone sandwich. The service was Soup Nazi casual. We wanted fries, but were so intimidated by the guy that opened the window a whole 2 inches wide that we forgot to order them. The place is a little dull with fading pictures of celebrities that had been there over the years. It made us sad to see these iconic photos fading away.    From Genos we ordered a steak, onion and ""whiz"". Their place is bright, shiny and flashy with lots of neon.  They also have pictures of famous visitors that are well taken care of and they have an impressive display of police patches from all over and a tribute to a local fallen police officer.  Their service, while a little cold, was at least amusing. We heard someone ask if they had mustard and someone yelled ""For What?!!!"" I guess they don't think their sandwich needs condiments. They have the ""When ordering speak English"" signs and the freedom fries on the menu. Call it what you want, but we are in America, people, and if you speak another language its hard to get your order right, right? At Genos, it was a little inconvenient to order and pay for our sandwich at one window and then move two windows down to order and pay for our fries at another window. I dont know if the same applies for drinks.   First, the fries from Genos were excellent; we loved them. The provolone sandwich from Pat Kings was a little bland and not too exciting. The ""whiz"" sandwich from Genos was better. My husband is, but I am not a ""whiz"" kind of person. I did find  the ""whiz"" at least brought out the flavor of the meat and was a better, less dull experience. The meat from both places was about the same.  I wish it were more of a grilled meat with some crusty edges instead of a kind of water saturated been sitting in a warmer, waiting for the crowds flavor. The bread used from both restaurants was excellent. It stands up to the juice and maintains its form. The onions......the onions on both sandwiches left a little to be desired. They both seemed to be lightly sautéed chopped onions. If they had been grilled rings of onion and were just slightly caramelized they would have added so much flavor.  I get it about the tried and true recipes handed down from generations before, but come on, if its better, its better. Be a little more open-minded to improvement.   Our opinion:  Me: Meh, the cheese steak sandwich at Tubby's in Charlottesville, VA is so much better than anything we had in Philly, but if I had to choose, it'll have to be Genos steak, onion and whiz. Dave: Johns- waterlogged in the seediest part of South Philly, we gave one of our sandwiches to a homeless guy downtown.

Thought that I absolutely had to come here to eat a Philly Cheesesteak. I actually was dissuaded to go to Genos because I felt like they were on steroids regarding advertising. I did a quick glance between Pat's and Genos and actually liked the relaxed view of Pats better. There were tour buses doing drive by's and there were high school students swarming at the time that I went.  My honest opinion: Just a meat sandwich. I've actually had better steak sandwiches in California. I think I should have probably tried Jim's in downtown.   Report: MEAT:  was tender and more on the salty side than Pat's. Juicy. Sandwich is about a foot long. WHIZ: (Cheese) was on the liquidy side. It should have been thick and cheesy ONIONS: I liked the onions on top. They are square cut and sauteed CHOICE: You have a choice between American cheese, whiz or Provolone. If you want a classic Philly, then get Whiz and onions SERVICE: Super quick, in fact instantaneous. I didn't even get a chance to blink and I had my sandwich piping hot in my hand. DRINKS: You slide down to the next window and order your drinks. A bottle of water is about $2.00. A regular soda is around $1.50.   In regards to the Ambience, its outdoor seating overlooking a community baseball park. The area has history in regards to immigrant populations. You could see old dumbbell tenements, an Asian community and Italian influence. It feels like a nice place to have lunch. The weather was right, so it was a nice day to eat outside.  Lunch: $10.00 for a drink and a philly cheesesteak. I should have had a local beer and some fries or something else to try. About an 8 to 10 minute drive from downtown. Pretty easy to get to. Oh and I got a complimentary Geno's pen (great marketing skills).   I would go here again, but not crave it. It was a good experience and it was cool to see it. I asked local cab drivers and local Philly people. It was a split review down the middle of which cheesesteak was better Genos' or Pat's. It's kind of like the chicken and the egg.

So, who the hell are they to tell me what language to speak and who are they to suggest America has an official legal language? Fact is, if they don't understand the language I speak then I guess they don't have to take my order. Period.  I don't need a sign demanding me what language to speak. ugghhh.  It seems the owner(s) have a bug up their ass towards non-English speaking customers.   Anyway,  this is not a even close to a good cheesesteak by any standard let alone Philly standards. The only saving grace for this hunk of slop is the roll. If it wasn't for the roll I would have asked for my money back.  This sandwich was at best average.  I don't know what all the fuss is about. Obviously, the folks giving this place 4 or 5 stars are tourists/from out town who never had Philly style cheesesteak. and/or anyone who doesn't know what an authentic Philly cheesesteak is.  The steak itself was dried-up,bland and leathery. There was hardly no cheez whiz on the sandwich. There was hardly no meat on the roll. You are basically paying 8 bucks for a good roll that cost them less than 10 cents.  Obviously, this place is resting on its laurels and is nothing more than a tourist trap serving up scrawny half-assed cheesesteaks and gouging the public.  They should be ashamed of themselves to pass off this slop as a Philly cheesesteak.  Do yourself a favor and go to Tony Luke's to experience a good Philly cheesesteak. Hell, even Jim's steaks on South street puts out a better sandwich. Those 2 places won't demand you to speak any language and you will surely get a better sandwich.

What better way to find out then to compare them side by side?   We split up - two of us bought two steaks from Pat's, the other two of us brought two steaks from Geno's.  My friend and I, both of us Philadelphians, picked up the Pat's steaks and went over to Geno's to locate our visiting friends.  I had a fleeting thought about suggesting we eat on neutral territory, somewhere in between the two establishments, but our friends had ordered two Geno's cheesesteaks as well as cheese fries to add to our artery-clogging smorgasborg.  I shrugged the thought it away - we had more Geno's food than Pat's, it was a slow night, there were many, many outside tables available, and I figured we would eat somewhere discretely.  Apparently, I'll whole-heartedly admit, despite being in Philadelphia for many years now, I may have underestimated the animosity of the rivalry.  But, for the record (this proves vital later... apparently...) Pat's condiments went on Pat's steaks, Geno's condiments went on Geno's steaks. Scout's honor.  We sat down to eat and we hadn't been eating for more than five minutes before a voice called out, ""Hey... did you just put our cheesesteak in a Pat's wrapper?!??  Let me see that steak!!!!"" We looked at each other, shrugged, but after a repeated demand, our friend obligingly went over the window with his Geno's steak in it's Geno's wrapper and showed it to him.  That seemed to satisfy them, and they quieted down for a little while.  And then... well, historians debate whether either the battle of Vicksburg or Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil War.  For this Cheesesteak War, the deciding moment hinged upon one highly processed, salty-but-sweet, tomato-based product.  Our visitors had left the ketchup off the Geno's steaks, leaving it up to us if we wanted it or not.  So, one of us went up to the condiment stand to get ketchup.  We then heard, ""That is messsssssssssed up!! You're stealing our ketchup and putting it on Pat's steaks!  That is messed UP, man! Hey, look, man, they're getting our ketchup to put on Pat's steaks.""  We thought they were annoyed and ribbing on us a little bit, but nobody sounded or appeared extremely angry or upset.  ""We're not,"" we tried to clarify.  ""It's your ketchup going on your cheesesteak.""  I thought to myself, ""Even so, they can't really be serious about this paltry amount (maximum two tablespoons full) of ketchup.""  Our comment initially didn't seem to make an impact, but after a few minutes there was a lull in the commentary.  I figured that was the end of that.  And then someone said, ""I can't believe it... The cops are here.""  ""What?? No way... there's no way they called the cops on us!!!""  I turned my head, and, lo and behold, there, in full Philadelphia police regalia, hands on his belt loops, is a policeman moseying up to our table.  At first he talks facing away from us, and for the first  few seconds I can't process what he's saying and if he's directing it to us or to the people behind us.  I just couldn't quite wrap my head around the fact that they CALLED THE POLICE over this.   ""We got a complaint that you guys are causing trouble here.  They are saying that you're stealing from them, that you're being difficult, that you're causing a scene.  This is private property and they want you to leave the premises.""  The list of accusations continued without interruption, without a pause for a response or a defense from us; our friend kept trying to get in a word in edgewise to give our account of the situation and to at least counter the accusation that we were ""stealing their ketchup,"" but the cop continued to talk loudly over him for the next few minutes.  Eventually, my other friend stood up and said, ""Come on.  Let's just go.  Let's just go,"" in an attempt to diffuse the situation.  I stood up, and we started walking away, with my other friend still persistently, but not belligerently, attempting to explain our side to the police officer.  As we were walking away, I was overwhelmed with a wave of anger.  From a logical, legal perspective, these horrid people were in the right - we were on their property, and they could kick us off if they wished. But to go to such levels to call the police??  To treat us paying customers so rudely when our biggest sin was to engage in the classic Philadelphia cheesesteak battle??  What a horrible business model, turning away paying customers who will now harbor a sense of ill-will towards Geno's. We weren't being belligerent customers; we were there sitting calmly and eating except when 1) we ordered 2) we were asked to show that we ordered Geno's steaks 3) we wanted ketchup. I've been a Philadelphian for seven and a half years now.  Many times, I've brought my visiting friends and tourists to Geno's.  I never will again.",6,"BuvPlRCcBlDndFkTSqyQxg"

So what if he wants people to order in English, the language spoken by the employees.  So many of Philly folks have relatives who were immmigrants and who assimilated.  I have a feeling that many have let their politics get in the way of a good tradition and a good competition.  I suspect many may have come to write 1 star reviews and perhaps never even ate here.  The bottom line is that it is not a one star sandwich.  The competition makes both Pats and Genos better, and truly creates a fun and  iconic landscape to get a cheesesteak.

Absolutely CRAZY.  And here's why:  I've been to Geno's once or twice before, a long time ago and things haven't changed much.  When my coworker and I was scheduled for a training up in King of Prussia, well, we couldn't drive past Philly without a stop at a cheesesteak joint.  As my coworker has never been to Philly (uh, how?!?!), I decided that if cheesesteak was what he was craving...well then, we have to do the Geno's/Pat's taste-off.    We start off at Geno's, and there was no one in line.  There was no one in front of me, and no one behind me.  No one walking up the street to come to Geno's.  So there really wasn't a need for the lady behind the counter to get *quite* as snotty as she was, when we didn't know what ""wit"" meant.  I mean ""wit"" what (it turns out - it means ""with onions"")?  Obviously, we're new here, and as it's not like we're holding up the line, the attitude wasn't really called for.  Eh.  Whatever.  We were hungry.  I *LOVE* cheese wiz, and as that is what the original cheesesteak was made with, well that's what I always order (before you doubt me - look it up.  I'm right.).  My coworker got his with provolone, because he's weird about eating ""plastic cheese"".  Whatever.  He quickly learned to rue his haute palette, as he bit into his cheesesteak - to find that the cheese was stone-cold and un-melted!  Have you ever had unmelted cheese on a cheesesteak?  It's not exactly gross, but well, it's not tasty either.  There is something about warm, melty, oozy cheese that is part of the cheesesteak experience!  To add insult to injury, both of our breads were a *wee* bit on the stale side (not ""3-day-old stale""...more like ""been-left-out-all-day-next-to-the-oven"" stale), and I didn't like that the meat wasn't quite as chopped up as I liked.  This reminded me why I stopped coming to Geno's after my second or third visit so long ago.  On this trip, we ate at 3 cheesesteak places.  Here, Pat's (see my review), and Jim's.  I have to say, that this was definitely bottom of the list for both of us.  Actually, I ranked this cheesesteak to be about on-par with Jerry's.  Yes, you read that right - Jerry's.  A NOTE: because of the ""rivalry"" between Pat and Geno's, I find it really hard to write this review without doing a comparison.  Normally, I try to avoid comparing one establishment against, another, as each should stand on it's own, however the rivalry between the two is so popular, that it's nearly impossible to eat a cheesesteak from one, without thinking of the other.",2,"aTVOFTxVdfdIhdPxcEt1Vg"

The three contenders were what I think are the most famous cheesesteak restaurants in Philadelphia, Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's.   I will start off by saying that I enjoyed the sandwiches at all three spots, very much. I ordered the cheesesteak the exact same way at each restaurant so it would be a fair comparison, with Wiz and no onion.   I will rate the cheesesteaks on their own, on each restaurants individual Yelp page.  In my personal opinion, here is how they finished.  1. Geno's 2. Jim's 3. Pat's  Why did Geno's finish first?  With only three ingredients making up these sandwiches, there wasn't a lot to compare.   The steak on the Geno's sandwich was the only one of the three that was in larger pieces, which I liked better. The steak on the Jim's and Pat's sandwiches were chopped up into finer pieces.    The Wiz on the sandwich at Geno's was a generous volume and evenly distributed on the sandwich.  The bread at Geno's was comparable to the bread at Pat's, but wasn't as good as the bread at Jim's. I'd say that this was the only ingredient of the three that Geno's didn't have the edge.

I looked up a few places, but ultimately wanted to go to the iconic Philly locations, Geno's & Pat's.   Well, to say the least, they were both horrible. Geno's was worst though. I got a philly with the regular fixings and it was so bad I took one bite & tossed it. It was cold meat, the cheese was not melted, and the bread was old. I couldn't believe how bad it was.  Still on the hunt for good cheesesteaks in Philly next time I come back. I recommend you listen to Yelpers & DO NOT give in to the hype.

The signage is very over the top, very bright and colorful, lots of lights.  They have pictures of celebrities posted around the front and I even saw a stripper's model picture there too (mad props for that one).  The guys who worked there were nice, it seemed like a clean-cut type of place. The price of the cheesesteak was about the same as Pat's, around $8.  I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz.  The steak was not chopped but sliced.  The onions were nicely grilled.  When I took my first bite, I thought it was good but not as good as Pat's.  The steak wasn't nicely seasoned as Pat's was and the cheese whiz was a bit watery.  The roll was also good but soft all around, not as crunchy as Pat's.  I ended up only eating one-third of the cheesesteak from Geno's and my wife ate another third of it.  I'm glad that I was able to try the Geno's cheesesteak but the next time I'm in Philly, I'm only going to Pat's.  Between the two Cheesesteak rivals, the service and price are very comparable but the flavor/taste goes to Pat's on this one.

Located directly across from Pat's, tourists and natives alike lined up in the streets (much to the chagrin of those driving on those streets) to sample this beefy treat.

Fortunately, I found one of the few open patio tables and went to claim it while I avoided the ordering ordeal.   Lucky for me and my hungry belly, Geno's churns out the cheese steaks like they do patriotic propoganda so I didn't have to wait long. The cheese steak itself was a lot more wieldy than I imagined, with a great bun-to-meat ratio. My first bite exposed me to two of the most important food groups - cheese and grease - and oh my, was it yummy. Watch out for errant cheese whiz or else you might be wearing it, which I assume would be a badge of pride in Philly. I ate with my face 5 inches from the table the entire time to avoid a cheese whiz mishap as I gobbled up that sandwich; finding no shame in licking my fingers to savor the greasy residue left behind. The bun was fresh, the grilled onions superb, and I am super happy I didn't get pretentious with my sandwich and order provolone cheese over the cheese whiz.

DRY Cardboard is the best way I could describe this sandwich. Save you money and time. There was a 30 minute wait. We had wanted to try Pat's but his line was more like an hour. Either way, I'd save yourself the trouble and just graze through Reading Terminal. South Street has some wonderful choices as well.

If you have to choose between Geno's & Pat's (personally, I'd choose Paesano's any day, even though they don't do cheesesteak!) then I recommend you choose Geno's for the meat and Pat's for the bread.    But really, my suggestion is: get more creative and go explore the other options, like Jim's and Tony Luke's and Dalessandro's, because they're all more juicy and flavorful than Geno's.

I'm a big fan of helping people learn English, and I am fluent in Spanish in order to communicate with my clients who don't speak English, but if you're visiting here in the US, you can surely learn a few phrases like ""wiz, wit"" and ""wiz, widout"" and ""plain"".

It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but the amount of meat actually in the roll is subpar for what you are paying.  We sat at one of their tables set up for outside eating (only seating available) and got to catch up on his 6 month trip to the US. But all the parking signs around the store say 20 minute parking only, and I understand this is to keep it moving so everyone can kinda maybe get a spot to stop and grab a cheesesteak.  They also gave us a Trump pin with our order and insisted we wear it, so this may be a turnoff to some patrons however if you know the history of Geno's where you have to speak English to order, it's not out of their character.

They're similar with outdoor seating and cash only! These places get pretty packed any time of day, make sure to bring cash and find a seat as soon as one opens up. I would also recommend taking public transportation or walking to these places since you can barely find parking in this neighborhood. What I admired about Geno's were the hundreds of police state official badges on the side of the restaurant. Huge respect for our armed forces! I did not like the fact that coffee was 75 cents and a bottle of water was $3.50. I'm a New Yorker and I was not going to pay MORE for water than coffee.

Tasty (mostly because of the whiz) during consumption, it leaves you with a full stomach and potentially clogged arteries after. Myopic behavior. The steak itself was too tough and much too greasy. My favorite part would probably have to be the bread - just the right amount of chew for a sandwich like this.  We also ordered fries with cheese whiz on the side.

I had never heard of this place and I wish I never had. The people who recommended Geno's saw it on TV. I read some reviews, paid attention to the bad ones, and wanted to try The Tourist Trap"".  My GF, her BFF and I had of all intentions of making this our first stop. We landed on Saturday morning, unpacked and headed right to the area. We were gonna do the Geno's/Pat's spit and get both, but the lines were outrageous. Pat's went around the building and Geno's was on the other block. Eh, well come later on in the week.  During that time we sneaked in two places, so I did have a gauge to work of off.  The next time we went, the line was considerably smaller. Pat's line was also smaller so we did the split. I go to Geno's and they go to Pat's. During this time I was told about the owner's (who is obviously of an immigrant decent) rants about being ""American"" and the importance of speaking English while ordering. I was even thinking of making up some weird accent, like Borat, to see what would happen. In my heart I wanted to have fun, but I really wanted to eat the ""cheese steak"" with out any fuss. Plus in the back of my head, I could hear my GF giving me crap for even thinking it.  While in line noticed all of the Star F**ker's pictures all spread out like, well, like cheese. Pictures of ""famous"" and people I had never heard of, all of which had signatures. Who cares? Way too much Hollywood fluff going on for me. On the sidewalk was a memorial for some of the police officers who have died in the line of duty, interesting.  I'm looking for the famous sticker, but not at the order window. Apparently, there are two order windows. One for the cheese steak, the other for the drinks and fries. Both counter people were rude, I have an idea why, and were very short.  At the window for the cheese steak, I told the behemoth of a man, which one I wanted (Provolone), before I got my change back, the sandwich was being given to me. Interesting. Not sure if they were pre-made or just fast.  Like cattle, you walk to the next window. There I had to tell the behemoth of a woman what I wanted to drink. Before I could utter a word, a guy comes from behind me and states he didn't get one of his sodas. She replies, ""You didn't get it"". This clever meeting of the minds lasted for 5 min. The witty exchange between the two ended by the man finally getting his soda. Walking away I finally notice the sticker. I really won't repeat it. I still feel nauseous thinking about the meaning and the history of signs like that. ""Whites Only"", ""No Mexicans"" so on.  Armed with my ""famous"" Geno's cheese steak, a drink, and fries. I notice that grease is seeping though the bag. Are you serious?! The last two sandwiches had little to no grease. Walking to Pat's I find my BF and her buddy. They grab a seat to wait for me.  Sitting there, I pull out the Geno's sandwich and my GF made her famous ""eeewwww"" face.  We had to rush to Independence Hall cause we had tickets for a tour. So my GF BFF decides to drive while we sit in the back seat to sample our food.  Let me put it this way; It sucked. If you decide to make public rant about your own controversial political views, you had better have the best Philly Cheese Steak in the world, the universe, to back you up.  I could have gotten a better tasting sandwich at one of the Greek places in Montebello.  It was bland. No flavor whatsoever. The bread was soggy from being saturated by grease.

Though, they lay down the meat in strips versus chopping it up (like every other cheesesteak place I've heard of). Im not saying that this fact makes it a bad cheesesteak, but it takes away from it just a touch for me.  There is definitely way too much hype about either one establishment, but I find the back and forth fighting like an old married couple to be quite humorous. If you're sitting at Geno's then someone near you or the people you're with are talking about the steak you got compared to the ones at Pat's and visa versa.  I don't agree with Vento's ""Speak english or GFTO"" mentality and that does sway me to across the street more...it is after all just a cheesesteak place.

Very street style atmosphere, covered outdoor (simple) seating            AMAZING BREAD            Very ethnic area, many shops nearby that sell in a family style market environment.  One shop nearby sold live poultry.  Other shops sold freshly made cheese.  Fruit stands line the streets nearby.  And some buildings have murals on the side nearby.  Great to just walk around this place.  Cons: A tiny bit over priced            Steak was awful, paltry amount, and was hard to go down.              I felt duped            No vinegar (for fries), and no mayonaise (for the cheesesteak) was available.                            No bathroom for paying customers and no public bathrooms nearby, 10 or more tables outside.  It's one thing to operate a small out the window shop locally, but this is a tourist place, and we drove an hour for to eat.  We had a very negative experience finding a company that would let us use their bathroom.       Overall:  This store is about what works for the owner.  The customer comes second.  They don't provide the condiments a reasonable New Englander would want for Cheesesteak and fries, a bathroom for paying customers despite having 10 tables (or so), and respect to hispanic immigrants (as they have a sign up that says, ""This is America, Speak English"").

The steak wasn't chopped the way I've seen philly cheesesteak but that doesn't mean it's good. Their meat was actually very tender, it was more like quality meat. Although, I'd want it to be very juicy and very fatty like. So, their cheesesteak really wasn't as good as Pats juicy and fatty Philly Cheesesteak.

I don't really know anything about either place other than my one visit today.  The cheesesteak is great. Thin, full slices of steak cooked well. Soft yet chewy rolls with a bit of an Italian bread taste. The meat is fatty and flavorful, but not greasy. The American cheese doesn't add much, it is a single slice only. I'll try with the cheese wiz next time, if I come back.   However, the staff are extremely rude and unpleasant. You wait in line, then feel rushed and unwanted at the counter. Don't be surprised to receive some dirty looks if they feel you are slowing them down.  Overall, a worthwhile visit if you're in the area, but be prepared for the rude, abrupt staff.  Here's the ordering protocol that they fail to put anywhere, but expect you to know:  Have money ready. They don't like giving change or waiting for you to get your wallet out.  Order only cheesesteak at first window, order in one sentence with all detail. You'll get your cheesesteak after a short wait.  Move to the next window where you order and pay for drinks. Again, exact change is expected and they do not want to wait.  Quick tip: If it's your first time here, I recommend looking at the menu before waiting in line, and deciding what you want. The line wraps around the building and you will have only one person in front of you when you first see the menu.   For me, the rudeness of the staff ruined an otherwise very good cheesesteak.

Third disappointment, sandwich wasn't even hot - luke warm.    Fourth disappointment, taste was awful!  My whole process was just a huge disappointment throughout.  I did not just take a $10 cab ride here to eat a tasteless and cold sandwich.  I would much rather eat a Great Steak Sandwich inside a mall than to come here.

The sandwich looks like what you would throw up after a proper cheese steak from anywhere else.  Which also makes me question why anyone needs to go to Philly.  Try Carls Steaks in NYC and save a 2 hour drive.  If you live in Philly, make the best of what you got.  The staff is either burnt out or seriously think too much of themselves.  Just because you have a glowing orange cheesesteak sign on your building and people come there for cheesesteak does not make it a registered UNESCO site.  Get off yourselves.  There is this crazy line system that they have in place and if you don't place the order right they whine and complain like they have something better to do.  The best story I have is that after buying $25 in cheesesteaks from Geno's I wanted to use their hot sauce (also horrible; just pure heat, no flavor) on my Pat's cheesesteak as well as the Geno's.  I would understand if I just didn't spend money there and did this but I just spent $25!  Some roid rage ape behind the counter started screaming at me to not do it or i have to leave.

Not because we have anything against Geno's, but because we tried his neighbor's steaks and were extremely satisfied. The bar was set high, and Geno's had a tough job to do.  I can't say much about Geno's. It wasn't piping hot, the beef was sliced and had no flavor at all, the provolone cheese was practically missing, and the onions were raw. Neither of these were appealing to my significant other and I. In fact, we had to order some lemonade to wash down the dryness of the steak. The only thing that might be superior at Geno's is the bread, which doesn't make up for the other things.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad night at Geno's or what, because we were largely disappointed with what we experienced here.   To make things worse, the bigotry that includes the signs all over the place is extremely disheartening. In a country that is proud of diversity, it felt terrible to see signs saying that you could only order in English. Is that why there were no Hispanic employees at Geno's and a few at Pat's? I would hypothesize that Geno's is of Italian descent, so why do they need to post ridiculous signs all over their ordering windows?  All of the political jibberish aside, we really did not find anything appealing about the cheesesteak.

The sandwich and fries look great as well.  9.5 out of 10  Taste/Final Analysis: This definitely met my rather lofty expectations. The bread was nicely toasted and the meat was was cooked and sliced perfectly. They could have probably seasoned the meat a little more as they let the cheese and/or onions do the flavouring. I really loved the Cheez Whiz on here and they put an abundance of it on here. The cheese fries were a good effort as well as the fries were nicely crisped and the nacho cheese was pretty decent.

As far as the ""best"" goes that is definitely not anything I saw today. All the hype this place has somehow garnered over the years has created a monster. It is a shame that has been plaguing hotels and restaurants more than ever lately; this place is living off its own legend, riding its own coattails, and doing its customers and previous employees a disservice. It's almost as if they no longer care about what they serve.   First off, there is no parking anywhere nearby literally it's a mess in this area if you aren't a local. The steak was ok at best the onions nonexistent the mushrooms rubbery and tasteless on their own. The worst of all, the bun, if you have the audacity to call it that. I would liken it more to a rubber chew toy you find in the tiny pet accessory section in a local food store. The cheese wasn't even melted! I could get over the lack of indoor seating and the fact that even in the 30* weather you have to take your gloves off and roll up your sleeves to avoid getting mystery oil (no way could you call it au jous) and ketchup all over you. Even the attitude from cashier. Three things were truly appalling to me here. 1) everything was premade. Our food was in front of us before we even finished ordering. Ew. Um how long has that been there? What if I was allergic to something in there and needed it custom? 2) The price was outrageous especially for how little food we even were served...in an outdoor restaurant....with no parking lot....and counter service....food cost should at least be mildly related to cost of food, utilities, and staff. $21 for two ""subs"" is insane! And the worst thing about this place: 3) they have the worlds most horrendously racist sign right on the cashier window. ""This is America. Speak English when ordering."" Oh my god. This is Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Unless your brother happens to be one of the thousands of tourists who journeys to Philadelphia from another country and never had the luxury of learning English as a second language.

Tangy, tasty, and juicy.  Have a lot of napkins to eat this.  2) American wit/witout = American Cheese on your steak.  My wife's favorite.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon during the summer. As expected, the line was fairly long. We waited about 20 minutes to place our order. A cheesesteak was $10. It was cash only and you had to order fries and drinks separately. As much as I didn't like their set up for placing an order, the seating and condiments were much worse. It was so uncomfortable sitting outside on their tables, especially under the hot sun, the wind blowing away your napkins, and numerous flies hovering over your food. Despite these conditions, the main concern is the taste of the cheesesteak. It was as tasty and as messy as I imagined. The portions were fine. It was a solid proportion of meat, bread, and cheese.  Overall, it was an okay experience and I still suggest you should give it a shot if you're in Philadelphia and want to cross it off your bucket list.

However, I will add that that the meat used, while more flavorful than Geno's, seemed to be rather gristly and could be quite dry. Geno's seems to use more whiz on their variation and that whiz makes its presence known.

When we came up on Geno's we noticed that Pat's was right across the street.  Shame on us for picking Geno's based solely upon the presentation of the venue.  Passing by Pat's looked a lil shabby, but the cheesteaks looked more appealing. The line at Geno's was long,but moved quickly..why? because they were shelling out already made sandwhiches.  The cashier was cool but when the person in front of us pushed the window back to hear the cashier, another coworker snatched the window back closed, which the cashier pushed right back open, THAT WAS RUDE. The steak on the cheesesteak had no flavor, and the only thing that made mine edible was dousing it in the juice from the cherry pepper.

The person I was with said people come from all over the world to eat here.  I replied that they sure as hell better speak English because Joey wasn't serving anyone who didn't.  And there are still signs at the windows telling customers they're not getting served if they don't speak English.  That's shameful as hell and I'm never going back for this reason alone.

He told me that these two places are famous and they have a long time feud going between the two places.  We first passed Pat's as we approached Geno's looking for a parking spot.  Since we found a spot across from Genos we figured we'd try them since it was really cold out.  I looked at the sign and said $9.00 for a sandwich??? OK, I figured it's gotta be good. We stepped up to the window and I noticed that nobody in the place was smiling or at least looked like they wanted to serve you.  I know a little about serving people from the other side of the counter as I have done it for close to 25 years. We tried to make conversation with the guy at the window who was not impressed or interested. He was really good at saying ""What'l ya have"" and then says "" Nine Dollaz"" while the guy to his right scrapes the meat off the grill and drops it into the bread.  Then he puts two slices of Provolone and slaps some little onion squares on it and wraps it in paper.  I asked what do you do for drinks and he then had a very lengthy conversation ""Next window"" and slid the window shut.  I followed directions and went to the woman at the next window and she was just as polite.  She said ""Two dollaz"" and handed me my soda. I had a bad feeling about how the famous cheese steak was going to taste.  I unwrapped it to find about 5 small slices of meat with a trace of provolone showing under all those onion chicklets falling out all over the place. They reminded me of the onion bits at Costco's food court, only larger. Cooked a little but not really glazed like a good onion should be on a sandwich like this.  Half of them fell out as I was eating.  While I was really trying to enjoy my $11 investment I looked around and could see why others would be offended. They really rub it in your face with all the signs. I told my buddy that it was probably the worst attempt of a cheese steak I've ever had.  You can do better at Quiznos which I happen to think makes a great sandwich.  I was extremely disappointed and wanted to get my wife a cheese steak because she grew up in Philly and I figured I'd try Pat's for her take home. There was no way I was going to make the same mistake twice.  The guys at Pat's were a tad friendlier, maybe because I told them how bad Geno's sandwich was but they definitely slammed a whole lot more meat on the bread without me even saying anything.  I took a bite of hers to compare and there was no comparison.  It was definitely heftier and tastier.  Now, mind you, I will never go back to either place because neither one is worth it in my opinion.  We froze our asses off at the outdoor tables while you could see a seating section in the center of the restaurant at Genos where I guess they let famous people eat indoors while they take pictures with them leaving everyone else to eat outside.  I didn't even want to ask to use a restroom. People, invest your hard earned money wisely by avoiding places like this. We passed many small eateries where I'm sure $11 buys a better sandwich and drink where the people smile and you can sit for awhile inside.  Needless to say we both agreed that if we're ever in Philly again we would hit up the other joints.

I came to Philly with, what I believe are, pretty realistic expectations regarding cheesesteaks.  Yes, I knew coming into it that Genos and Pats were tourist traps and that their might be better cheesesteaks elsewhere throughout Philadelphia.  But at the end of the day, after trying four different places, a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak and it didn't really live up to the hype at all.  With that said, and amongst the 4 places, I would have to rank these in the following order:  1) Jim's Steaks (3 stars):  Best place to sit and eat. They had the largest dining area with an upstairs area.  It was not air conditioned though.  As for the cheesesteaks, it was the best in terms of flavor, service, bread consistency. Bread wasn't too chewy or hard.I had it prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions) and mushrooms.  Better service than Geno's and Pats.  2)  Ishkabibbles (solid 2.5 stars, maybe 3):  Very comparable to Jim's but there's absolutely no where to sit with the exception of 6 barstools.   The gremlin drink is overrated too...but I had to try it.  I had it wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and mushrooms.  Better service than Geno's and Pats.  3)  Geno's (1.5 stars due to lack of smiles/service, but I'll round up to 2 for the hype and flourescent lights):  I like the bread but the meat was pretty flavorless.  Meat was in big slices and not chopped up.  I had it both with wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and prov/wit (provolone chesse and onions).  This was, by the way, the first place I tried.  They have outdoor seating so if it's cold, it's not the best place to eat there.    4)  Pat's (solid 1.5 stars.  I won't round up to 2 since it's the least favorite of the four places):  The bread is softer and the meat definitely had more flavor than Geno's. The meat was chopped up.  BUT it was sooooo greasy that it gave me an upset stomach.  I had it with prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions).  They also have outdoor seating only.    All in all, and if I'm in Philly again, I'm going to try Tony Luke's, Campos, Dalessandro's, and maybe a street vendor next time.    BOTTOM LINE:  Skip the hype at Genos and Pats.  One of them may have started the cheesesteak craze, but the other establishments have made it better. It's time for Genos and Pats to catch up to the 21st century.  Word of advice to Genos and Pats:  SMILE and appreciate your customers!",0,"q-vIVTIAcBQ8lkglLERlww"

We had it with Cheese Whiz and Provolone (okay... so we ordered two! at Geno's... don't tell my doctor) and the Whiz definitely was better. The bread also seemed more substantial at Geno's, which I liked. The meat seemed more tender and flavorful at Geno's, which is another mark for them.  To be honest, though, I was underwhelmed. The sandwiches were good but we expected an epiphany when we took our first bite and that just didn't happen.

I always get ""wiz with"" ...cheese is cheese wiz and with sauteed onions. The cheesesteaks are made very quickly, with lots of meat and lots of cheese on a huge roll. I always feel very happy when eating this huge cheesesteak. Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.  I also find the Geno's experience to be very fun. When I go, I'm usually in a car cram-packed with 20-something kids craving greasy, filling food. I am usually not the one driving, so I find it fun on the adventure of finding parking.

Go to Geno's for the history and because you have to try it just to say you were there.  But don't be fooled - this is a tourist trap, nothing more.    Geno's makes their steaks with more of a sliced cut than Pat's chopped meat.  It really doesn't change the flavor one way or the other.  They offer a few different cheeses to top your steak with: wiz being the original go-to.  A problem with Geno's is the price.  You pay ballpark prices for a mediocre sandwich.  Last time I was there it was $8.50.  That might not sound like a lot, but for what you get it's thievery.    Geno's has the nice facade and it feels cleaner than Pat's, which is more dimly lit.    I was a fan of the hot sauce they provide to top your steak with.  It's HOT.  Don't overdo it, but it's a nice (free) add-on to make it a bit different.  One huge plus for them is the availability.

The sandwich was dry, the meat had no flavor and the onions were so raw that I had that annoying onion taste in my mouth for a while until I got back to the hotel and brushed my teeth...UGHHH...DON'T WASTE UR MONEY HERE...I've tasted better in NYC...don't be fooled by the celeb hype and the BRIGHT lights...  Then, I quickly made my way across the street. I order one from Pat's and I could tell just by watching them make it that it as going to taste WAY BETTER.

And I've been going to Geno's for over 30 years. In all that time, they have never deviated from using great ingredients and keeping a crystal clean kitchen.

Like I said in my review of Pat's it's still defiantly better than anything you're going to find outside of the Philly area. With that being said Geno's is my least favorite of the 10 cheesesteak places I've tried in Philly. Pat's and Geno's both use a low quality meat, but I think Pat's pulls it off better because they chop the meat up and that sort of masks the stringy fat that's in the meat. Geno's is sliced and that makes it so you really feel the fat and gristle when you bite into it.  Go do the Pat's v. Geno's thing for fun but then go try some better places. So far my favorites have been Dalessandro's, John's Roast Pork, Cosmi's Deli, Gooey Looie's and Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop and there are many more that I'm yet to try that are likely better than Pat's or Geno's.  My current rankings:  1. Dalessandro's  2. John's Roast Pork 3. Gooey Looie's 4. Cosmi's Deli 5. Joe's Steak & Soda Shop 6. Ishkabibble's 7. Chubby's Steaks 8. Jim's Steaks South Street 9.

Much more picturistic compared to the other places if you like taking pics of tourist spots.  Geno's has the least Cheesesteak selections compared to the other places. It's either a steak with your choice of cheese with or without onions or a Pork sandwich I think but not too sure since I only order the Cheesesteak.  Like Pat's- parking can be tough, outdoor eating area, no restroom if you eat there and 2 windows to order- 1 for the steaks and the other for fries and drinks.  I ordered a Cheesesteak with wiz and onions. The bread is better than Pat's. The Wiz was very watery. But it was an okay Cheesesteak nonetheless.  I'm not going to comment about the attitude about staff being abrupt or rude because the staff at Pat's and Jim's act the same way too at times. Or the perceived political controversy because we're talking about food here. You have a right to eat here as well as not to eat here. That's your choice.

Based just on the Cheesesteak, Geno's edges out Pat's.  It's assembly line style ordering and pick-up.  You order on the street, you pay and eat outside, and get your condiments off the sidewalk.  That should tip you off that the service is nonexistent, so deal with it.  The bread at Geno's is a chewy and soft baguette packed with thin whole sheets of steak, chunky onions with a glassy sheen and your choice of American, Provolone or Cheez Wiz.  It feels more substantial and juicier when the steak is whole, not cut into shreds, and though it could stand a little seasoning, it's actually the cheese and bread that gives the sandwich its body and flavor.  By the way, the signage here is vaguely offensive.  ""I want my country back"" is one such gem.  Back from what?

For my first visit, I chose Geno's over Pat's, based on my friend's recommendation and the glowing neon Orange Americana of it all.   The actual cheesesteak was...pretty boring honestly. Seriously...I never understood the big deal anyways. The steak was nothing special, the cheese (either whiz or real) was really nothing special. Only the bread was above average. But honestly...nothing going on here. For a real, actually delicious cheesesteak, go to your local gourmet deli or try Uncle Sam's Subs in Pittsburgh (yes, Pittsburgh!).  But who comes here for the actual taste of the food? It's really for the experience. It was cold, rainy and March when I was here. The tables were wet, people were eating standing up. The people were hodge-podge of local east-coasters (totally New Jersey stereotypes) and tourists (like me or Bob and Jane from Iowa). The intersection of Passyunk and....every other street in South Philly...was jammed and busy and pointless as you've seen it on TV.   Recently, Geno's has become famous for their right-wing politics more than their food. Every employee wore shirts and multiple signs read ""this is America, order in English!"" Which is both funny and somewhat hypocritical. I'd rather it said ""this is America, order in American!"". Ah well. And yes, they sold Freedom Fries, not French Fries. And there were books on display excoriating Mumia The Terrorist. And pictures with Rudy Giuliani eating there. Good times. Just accept it for what it is, be amused by it, and move on.

Bottom line....coming to Pat & Geno's was worth the trip here ONLY to say that I have been there but the food is not worth bragging about or even coming back too if I am in desperate need or craving for a true Philly Cheese Steak.   Too conclude or trip in Philly 8 hours later....I called a buddy of mine who is a Native Philly Residents and he informed me about a spot in North Philly called ""Paganos"".....we stop here on our way leaving Philly and if you want to know the rest about this GOD SENT PLACE....then you have to read about its page.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/paganos-steaks-and-hoagies-philadelphia#hrid:PLWl2w8WgwYOueR_A2hXrQ",1,"6HP9PO7TPEPCGSgwd6oSUA"

Pat's had a lot more options and which would probably be preferable to someone staying in the area. As a side note, the lines were really long and I almost wanted to turn around, but they were surprisingly fast. The seating is cramped so take your sandwich to the bar across the street, it's looks like a car repair shop.... 4 stars are given as I did not gave enough cheese steaks from the area to call them the best.",0,"KW2UdbpARuS2XBv0Njjr0w"

One could rant on the awful racism that is plastered all over the establishment. Another direction could be the deplorable customer service they display even in some of their signage which directs you like you are a three year old.  The easiest and most direct route is the fact that the establishment is nothing more than a glorified tourist trap that has made it's name and money on the backs of others claiming to be ""true Americans"".  For this yelp I'll just focus on the food and leave the other stuff to those with more time on their hands ;)  As many others who have been sucked into this tourist trap I had an expectation of having an excellent authentic Philly Cheesesteak. After all if you didn't grow up in Philly you assume you have only experienced mere imitations at your local sandwich shop or perhaps even frozen food section. Well after eating a cheesesteak from Geno's my first thought was, wow I think I'll stick to the frozen ones.  The cheesesteak tasted a bit like a piece of cardboard you may have munched on when you were five (hey maybe that's why the signs are written that way) with some cheese and lots and lots of grease... Did I mention it was greasy. I was very disappointed but hey it was a $9 learning experience, but for that price I could have picked up two at Wawa and been more satisfied (no, Wawa does not have the best cheesesteaks for those reading this that are not from around here)  Let's face it, no matter what we yelp people will go to Geno's just to say they went there, that's how they stay in business. Just a word to the wise, when you have choked down that greasy cheesesteak, don't bother trying another one, save the 9 bucks for Pat's across the street so you can say you tried them too. Then when your finished with Pat's go and find a real authentic Philly cheesesteak. :)   If you are wondering where... Hey that's what your yelp is for :) Look up somewhere with good ratings from real Philadelphia residents. I can point you towards Tony Luke's but hey I'm a New Yorker who is transplanted to Delaware, so Im not up on the latest and greatest Philly has to offer.",8,"xd_mrTMdvZ0Dw3m9TSQDGg"

I come here all the time with my BF whenever I come up to PA. love just getting the regular cheese steak with the whizz cheese and onions. It has more flavor in the sub with the whizz cheese. I've tried it with provolone once, but it wasn't AS great. It doesn't even take long to make, so right after you pay for it they have it ready for you. But I think the sub is a bit over priced. It is $9 just for one. But the cheese and onion does NOT cost extra. The sub itself is so juicy. I love the juiciness of the sub! The bread they use is pretty good. I'm not sure what they use, but it seems like it's a mix of sour dough and french bread. The meat is not just some thin layer as they have at Pat's cheese steak. The meat is a LOT better at Geno's. Please do not use there hot sauce. It is REALLY hot and over powering. So than you won't get a good taste of the sub. There cherry peppers are amazing too. It can be a bit over powering to those that can not take things that are spicy. I really do not recommend putting anything on the sub itself other than how it comes.  DO NOT GET THERE CHEESE FRIES! I have to say that I was REALLY disappointed. It was really salty. The cheese they use is the whizz cheese. The fries seem similar to Wendy's friends. It is soggy.  The fries do NOT come with the sub, nor does the drink. A drink is about $4? So to anyone that goes here I recommend you bringing your own drink! They don't even give free refills for an over priced drink.   I REALLY RECOMMEND GENO'S OVER PAT'S ANY DAY!!  THIS PLACE IS OPEN 24/7!",1,"XOdUnYZgNQOIH9cR2RbXRA"

Everyone says when visiting Philly you have Togo to Pats and Genos we'll my husband and I couldn't decide so we picked up cheesesteaks from both and ate half of each side by side. We visited in February so we couldn't enjoy the outdoor seating which I'm sure is really cool in the warmer months. In this - Geni and Pats are dueling businesses - directly across from on another!!! Right off the bat Geno's seems more of a commercial spot, down to their packaging and branding which Geno's is definitely better than Pats.  But all in all-Genos was okay but not all we thought it was cracked up to be.  Genos steak isn't as seasoned as Pats and is kept in whole slices inside the bread. Pats is chopped up, season and sautéed in the onions, bringing out a way better flavor. Genos bread is also softer and so it doesn't hold up as well. Genos gave more cheese and peppers and mushrooms which at first I appreciated. As soon as we opened them both up we were happier with Genos for that reason but it turns out that it didn't help Genos in our taste test. Genos wasn't bad, which is why I gave it 3 stars but in our opinion Pats was way better!",2,"u9kOfKnATpAo0JD3ExVzOA"

This was seriously one of the worst cheesesteaks I have ever had. It really is over-hyped. Why did I go here?   I am stationed in Maryland (Go AIr Force!) and my family and I were driving on I-95 here in town and at around 3PM i had a vision of an amazing dinner! For some reason Philly popped into my head. So I told the family, ""Hold on; we are going to Philly; I want a cheesesteak...from that famous place!"". So, I stayed on 95 going North and braced for the 2 hour drive.   Got to Philly...never been; very nice! Drove straight to Geno's and was amazed how cool the environment was. Its a cross between Ghetto and Suburban...Pretty sure the cops and the mafia have told the thieves, murderers and gang bangers to STAY away from the tourist and white people! lol....because there were alot of white people and oddly enough kids and stuff in that area. Anyway...it was inviting but yet made you stay on your toes about where you actually were...in a big city!  So the line to get the sandwich was quick ($9...cash only!) then another line to get drinks and fries! All and all its about $30 for 2 cheesesteaks and 2 sodas and fry.   Enough about the dumb stuff, here is the down low:  Pros: environment culture lively experience  Cons: expensive crowded no exceptional taste to sandwich dry bread was chewy  So all and all, the place was cool, lights definately made a difference in my choice of places (Genos or Pats), but it really did suck!

Lucky me.  Greeted by people shouting ""Speak English!"" and ""Sopranos!"". Dizzy with confusion a middle-aged woman sporting a coffee in sweatpants saying ""Juicy"" where the sun don't shine tells me if I want to return home I need to find the ""Whiz of Geno's"". But beware of the ""King of Steaks"".   The people tell me to follow the ""Pash E. Unk Road"" and with my lil' dog we journey down the magical street passing tanning spas, realtors, salons, cheese shops, gyms and more tanning spas.  After befriending a smelly old man, a drunken Eagle's fan, and an illegal alien we arrive to a tower of neon proportions complete with a blown-up photograph of a cheese steak. As we approach an angry beast wielding a spatula blocks our path.   ""You must be the King of Steaks"" I state and the man smirks and replies ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. I'll toss in some free fries."" It was a good offer but not good enough...  ""NEVER!"" and I turn to whisper in the Eagle's fan ear. The fan goes ape shit  and pummels at what was the ""King of Steaks"".   Now what did I say in his ear you might ask?   ""We won the Super Bowl.""  At last the quest is finished.  ""What do you want?"" cries out a man behind the counter.   ""The Whiz please!"" I said with confidence as he hands me a cheese steak made with 100% whiz.   ""Oh... this is it? What a rip off!""  ""Well just click your heels together fag!"" shouts the smelly old man.  ""Que?"" asks the illegal alien.  So I do and everyone laughs at me for wearing ruby slippers, clicking my heels, outside of ""Geno's"" at 2am.   The only problem about this dream is that it is not a dream. This place, this Oz, this timeless void does exist. It's open day and night all year round for you. Come and experience it for yourself. Be mesmerized by the sheer audacity of it all.

I'll say it; we can get a much better cheesesteak from any pizza place/sub shop back home in Buffalo.  That being said, here's what I thought:  Geno's:    Delicious roll.  Nice and dense and chewy, I preferred it much more than Pat's.  The steak is served whole, in slices, but there is not a lot of meat at ALL to fill up that dense, chewy roll.  I got mine ""wit"" onions, but they weren't cooked down enough and weren't overly soft.  Also, they were piled right in the middle of the roll, so the proportions were off until I opened it up and used my finger to redistribute it along the whole roll.  The cheez wiz on Geno's meat liquefied and melted off, dripping off onto the paper.       The seating and atmosphere at Geno's is much nicer, it's very well lit, cleaner, and more tourist-friendly.  I have to say, though, it was awkward standing behind some foreign customers (speaking to each other in a different language) and watching as they saw the article taped to the window and the sign stating to ""Speak English"".  They took some pictures of the signs and laughed, but still... awk-ward.     We went in January and there was basically no one waiting in line outside.  The only place to eat is outside, too, so prepare to freeze your hands off as you devour your food!  Also:  separate ordering windows for steaks vs fries, but I didn't notice a SIGN saying such, just the irritated girl at the window telling people to go down to the next window to order fries.   Seemed weird, especially since there was no one waiting.   Pat's:    Less inviting location, not all lit up as well as Geno's.  Signage seemed older and more beat up.    The roll was good, perfectly acceptable but not as amazing as Geno's.  There was LOTS more meat than Geno's , which is definitely more my style.  Pat's chops their steak up, which, I discovered, might be an easy way to disguise that their meat isn't as high quality as Geno's since there was LOTS of gristle in my sandwich and none on Geno's.   The cheese wiz didn't melt away into oblivion on the Pat's sandwich, which was nice.  The onions were OVERdone, however, with a burnt taste to some of them.  The onions were nicely disbursed through the chopped up meat, but that only meant I got the burnt taste through my whole cheesesteak since I couldn't scrape them off.     So in Summary: - Pros and cons to each which made it impossible to choose which was better.  Wish I could make a combo of the two to make one perfect sandwich!      Geno's= Much less steak but nicer quality steak in solid slices.  Better roll.  Cheez wiz melts away and drips off the roll.  More dense/less cooked onions piled right in the middle.   Pat's:  Much more steak, cut up/diced up and very full of gristle/fat.  Onions mixed in well throughout but overdone and some were burnt.  Cheez wiz stayed intact and blended well with the beef in each slice.",0,"fwm40GvyFyqwvrpr9TY_dA"

You then hear Pat's is the better option. Next up is Jim's. Finally, you realize the true good cheesesteak of the ""majors"" is Tony Luke's.   In any case, the point is that Geno's is at the bottom of that hierarchy. Maybe they used to be good, but now they just ride on tourist popularity. The meat is dry, there are very few toppings options, and you walk away every time feeling like you could probably get a better cheesesteak most anywhere else.  Also factored into my impression of Geno's is their blatant xenophobia.

After circling the block a couple of times looking for a parking spot, it was about 1 pm on a Saturday.  I walked the block back to Geno's.

There was no meat in the bite and the bread was chewy.  To be honest, the whole sandwich tasted like a bad French dip.

All in all very poor , I can get a better tasting cheese steak from papaya king on the corner of 42nd and 9th for $7.50 with fries and a drink.  And to be fair I went across the street to try Pats king of steaks same crap!   Final word can get a better cheese stake for half the price in NYC",0,"3xBvWli88k-fhlnpui5iRg"

On a time crunch, the line for Pat's was almost triple the length of Geno's so I decided to order myself a cheesesteak even though it's against my foodie religion. Bottom line: It was a VERY basic cheesesteak. I expected a little more from them honestly. Below I'll list the main differences between these two venues:  Geno's: - Doesn't chop their steak (why???) - Lower quality meat - Not enough wiz - Racist - Typically rude staff  Pat's: - Chops their steak (yay!) - Higher quality meat - Plenty of wiz - Not racist - Typically friendly staff",1,"cnKpsQrnsKZQNMYn0ZaLUg"

Since every local will tell you a different spot for their favorite place we said to ourselves, ""Hey, why not try all of them!""  So we had 4 cheesesteaks in a span of 2 days. Felt like shat afterwards, needless to say.   Here's my review of Geno's below along with three other famous spots (all wiz wit since we didn't like the provolone):  Geno's: The ordering process was pretty quick.  Meat was most flavorful according to others in our group. My only complaint but a major one would be the bread.  It was pretty chewy. That pretty much ruined the sandwich experience there for me.   Pat's: Right down the street from Geno's, we actually ordered the Provolone here but wished I would've tried the wiz.  The bread here was much better and meat to onion to bread ratio was perfect.  Tony Luke's: The wait here was longer than Pat's and Geno's but worth it.  You get free pickles and sweet peppers here which is pretty cool.  My only complaint is that they don't put in enough onions or else it could have been more flavorful.  Jim's: This place seems to be growing in popularity quickly and I think might be newer out of the four spots.  The line was pretty long but you do get to see how they make the sandwiches right through the glass pane in front.  It was unorganized when I was there, they forgot to give me my order of sweet peppers and over charged me a sandwich while one guy was throwing me attitude on top of it.  The sandwich seemed to be lacking in flavor though.  I know this sounds terrible but it was lacking that old school grease! LOL  Also, check out their upstairs dining area where you can find autographed photos of celebs that have dined there (who is DeMzel Washington?? haha).  Here's my overall rating starting with the best:  1) Pat's 2) Tony Luke's 3) Jim's 4) Geno's  There will never be one clear winner for the cheesesteak king title since there are so many differing opinions out there but it's still fun tasting them all to figure out for yourself!

Recently, since about 1999 if that is recent, the place has suffered a barrage of bad publicity, bad stocking choices, and bad management changes that has spiraled not only the image that Geno's spent so long building, but the quality of product and service.  Look - here's the deal - you are in South Philly.  Regardless of how gentrified or diversified you think the area has gotten, you are still in South Philly.  Many generations have grown-up and still live in the same neighborhood, street, and even house as the ones before (both brother and father still on same street and even brother now living in father's birth house).  The South Philly Italian culture is very different than most people from more worldly and exposed regions may be accustom to and it tends to grate them the wrong way or espouse an emetic feeling from their deep suppressed nethermost region.  Geno's, not unlike most things and people from Philadelphia, are over criticized and not appreciated for what it is.  Note much in Philly has some ulterior motive or purpose, or tries to cater towards a specific demographic.  It is, truly, just what it is.  Geno's grew up around the Italian market which was a place immigrants went during the 30s and 40s to obtain cheap, poor quality, food during the post-depression era.  Once the yuppies (of which I admit I have grown into) moved into the area, they tried to make it a high-end outdoor Dean and DeLuca ... it isn't that, and you shouldn't be surprised if the locals get a little ticked off when they see their neighborhood grocery store or for that matter steak place start to change.  I remember going here as a kid and getting a steak sandwhich being surrounded by all people I knew from the neighborhood.  We used to go after school sometimes and it would be all Catholic school kids from around the area.  It wasn't until Oprah got a hold of this place, and the roaring 90's took foot, that the almighty dollar drew in more tourists and outsiders.  Most tourists would just settle on grabbing a steak from Oliveri's or on South Street rather than venture down to ""Pass-shunk"" (not Pas-e-yunk even if that is how you pronounce it).  Bottom line - it's South Philly ... if you are coming here for sightseeing and a steak, don't you want the full experience?  If you have ever been to Italy, in particular the ""real"" northern industrial towns of Italy (Torino, Milano, Verona, Bologna) then you know, as I do, that South Philly is about as Italian as you can get, and Geno's is a close second.  The attitude is part of our culture, accept it or grab a steak from a tourist trap on Independence Mall.  That said --- whew, nice rant huh, the steaks are OK and nothing special ... I prefer actually Jim's on South.",5,"CmTG_69V7hi1z08-zZXkxg"

I say this because the most frequent argument regarding the iconic sandwich is ""Pat's or Geno's""? The answer, as anyone who lives here knows, is neither. Better steaks can be had in other local chains as well as on many Philly street corners, but Geno's is fine for what it is.  It has a walk-up window where customers can order their food (in ENGLISH, dammit! They make a point of letting you know that to help rid the line of pesky foreigners and their ""biftecks du fromage"" or whatever), a window to pick it up, and some outdoor seating to enjoy your food in whatever language you want.  Service is about what you'd expect at a stationary food cart. Make your order, get your food and go away. If you want bottle service or valet parking, you've come to the wrong cheesesteak spot.   The actual food is fine as well. The steaks are smallish but tasty, the fries are made fresh and hot with enough salt, and they didn't screw up the fountain soda either. Nothing to rave about for veterans, but newcomers to the cheesesteak experience will likely enjoy it.  Overall, Geno's is a solid representation of cheesesteaks for anyone who hasn't had one.

As an adult, I know that the most popular places are not always the best nor most authentic.  What do you visit Geno's for?  The experience & the photo-op would be the most obvious answer.  If you have a friend that is a local, he or she will probably kindly accompany you to Geno's; but, will then recommend a better spot down the street or a neighborhood away.    Knowing this, I still ordered a cheesesteak with Provolone & put everything on it (including cherry peppers).  I also ordered the cheese-fries.  Eating this reminded me of a Saturday baseball game, and my gastric anticipation was quietly settled.  The steak was unseasoned, and I thought I would get a larger variety of toppings (like sauteed mushrooms & peppers).  I was wrong.  I was a tourist.  I was making a mental note to make sure that I stop by Pat's at the beginning of my next trip, and then finish said trip with a ""real cheesesteak spot"".    I admired all the pictures of famous people on the walls.  (""ooh President... ooh Oprah... ooh so-and-so"")  The line wasn't that long, and we did get a table.  I took a pic in front of the neon sign in the daylight, and that was about it.  925 reviews, and a legacy to support it.  The owner passed last year, I believe.. and I'm sure he  wanted to ensure that Geno's would be around forever...  As far as the xenophobic sign on the window, patriotism is only so far from ignorance at times.  We are all immigrants, in some way.  Philadelphia knows that well.  The Italian community should.  Blatantly stating ""Speak English"" is unnecessary at a glorified sandwich deli.  When ordering from the menu, printed in English, what other language could one speak?  I didn't let this deter me from ordering my food, but I wasn't surprised that the sign was posted.  Out of all the other -isms that have negative connotations, tourism is one that we really can control.  They've only typed what many people vocalize every day.

The steak is as mediocre as it gets.  It's typically super crowded.  This is not a sandwich crafted with care, it's just a slapped together waste of money.  It's only useful for a late night visit after a night of heavy drinking.  Even then, go to Wawa or something.  At least you can find SOMETHING decent there.  ^^^This was my review of Pat's steaks across the street from Geno's.  Take all the same stuff and just enhance the negative aspects that much more and you have my review of Geno's.  The staff is a little more condescending and weaselly.

They are conveniently right access the street from one another.  We started at Pats.  They chop the steak they put on their sandwich.  Of course we got onions, and wiz basically we asked for the cheesesteak that made them famous.  It was good.  The roll was delightful and I was very happy with a tasty cheesesteak.  We then went across the street to Geno's.  Their meat is sliced not chopped.  We asked the same of Geno's, serve us the cheesesteak that made you famous.  The meat appeared to be soaking in an au jus  which mixes amazingly well with the cheese sauce.  The texture of the meat was good as were the onions and the roll.

Speaking of the hoagie roll, it comes on a roll that is to die for. The sandwich is a perfect mix of fresh doe with the other flavors from the meat and onion mixing togeather. I also suggest putting about 4-5 hot peppers on the sandwich which they offer at a ""condiment bar"" after you pick up your sandwich.

Long story short: If you gave me sliced beef, cheese, and some long bread, I can make a cheesesteak as good as Geno's. I'm not kidding at all.  There are some basic, simple foods that various restaurants have proclaimed to have the ""best"" or ""original"" and, whenever I have tried, I have responded with a big ""meh"". The reality is the gap between ""good"" and ""world's best"" for relatively simple foods like burgers, cheesesteaks, ramen, grilled cheese sandwich, mac and cheese, etc. is just not that huge.  Sure, someone can use USDA prime aged ribeye for the sliced meat in their cheesesteak and it would be better, but why would you slice $15-20/lb prime aged ribeye to use in a cheesesteak? Why wouldn't you eat it as a ribeye steak? Likewise, you can use prime aged ribeye ground up for a burger, but what kind of nutbag would you be to do that?  As another reviewer noted, the generic cheesesteak chain you see in the food courts offer cheesesteak that's as good as Geno's, and maybe better in many cases.

The staff is not the most personable BUT all you have to do is place your order and pay.. ""wiz wit, wiz wit out etc"". Its pretty simple.. You don't need to become friends with them! The Yelper complaining about being unable to add condiments is completely wrong. When placing your order when you say ""wit"" that means onion. For those who don't know the slang just ask for onion and they'll put them on! The condiment ""stand"" is NOT down the street its literally next to the window. So to be fair condiments are available 2 steps from the window!

I must also mention the generosity of Geno's. They value the service of police officers and firefighters. There are thousands of police and fire department patches hanging in cases on the walls. In the unfortunate instances where public servants have been killed in the line of duty the late Joey Vento and Geno's have donated thousands upon thousands of dollars to their families. This is commendable and its greatly appreciated some still publicly support the police. Back in 2008 when the 100+ year old Mummer's Parade, a Philadelphia tradition was in jeopardy of cancellation due to the city cutting funds Joey Vento of Geno's among others led the charge and donated tens of thousands of dollars to save the parade.

See Donavan McNabb play in person in an Eagles uniform 3.  Eat a REAL Philly Cheese Steak in Philadelphia  Well, I was about 2 months too late to accomplish goal #1 and the DAY that I arrived to Philadelphia for the first time in my life, the Eagles trade McNabb to a conf rival, which left me with only goal #3.  Now I should preface this review by saying that I'm not exactly an expert on philly cheesesteak sandwiches as I've only had one in my whole entire life.  But talking to people who've visited/lived in Philly they say Geno's is the place to go, so onward to our trip we go to the city of brotherly love.  Don't be overwhelmed by the super duper long line cuz they are damn efficient.  There's two lines, one for the sandwich and a second line for fries, sides, drinks, etc.  Playing it conservative, I had a plain cheeseteak sandwich with no sides and a side of utlra cheese greese fries.  The sandwich itself was about $7 and the cheese fries about $3.  I'd have to say that it's not the cheapest of lunches and there's probably better alternatives out there, but hey I'm in Philly and I deperately wanted to have my first time experience at some place historical.  Well, nothing to brag about, sandwich and cheese fries were good nothing spectacular, but like I said not too experienced with that cuisine.

His wife and son named their first born son Geno who now works with his father.  I thought that was a cool story to share.  My visiting daughter and family wanted to try some ""famous cheesesteaks"", so off we went to the two big rivals, right across the street from each other.  The family was all waiting for my daughter and I at Pat's, while we were at Geno's.   I'll start with first impressions: My daughter desperately needed to use the restroom and Pat's told her to go over to the park adjacent from them!  We did and there was no restroom!  Geno's was right there, so we asked them and they slipped her into the back and left her piddle. She came out saying wow this place is so clean!  Now we get to friendliness, cleanliness and decor.  Pat's is old and dirty and has not spent one dime of their profits to stand out in these three fields.  Geno's on the other hand has put a lot into these areas.  Now for the cheesesteaks:  Even though we were all headed to Pat's, my daughter and I were so impressed with Geno's that we ordered our steak and fries there. The other five in our party stayed at Pat's.   My daughter and I took our order from Geno's over to Pat's to eat with the others ( tacky for sure and I would have rather ate at Geno's because of the cleanliness and decor).    First of all to order a sandwich and fries at Geno's, you must order them and pay for them separately at 2 different windows,  I can see where this works for them at busy times, but we were the only ones there.    The meat at Geno's is much, much better than at Pat's.  Everyone, but my stubborn son in law agreed.  The bread is better at Pat's.  The onions are raw at Geno's and sauteed at Pat's.  With a grilled sandwich I would have preferred the sauteed, but I did order a cheesesteak hoagie, so that may be the reason.  Pat's uses more cheese.  I had provolone.   All in all, if you add it all up, Geno's definitely has the better of the two cheesesteaks and wins hands down for decor, cleanliness and friendliness.",8,"Kj-u8Yq1d3mLKitWsDAxpg"

I grabbed the Thursday 10:20am Megabus from outside Javits and hit Philly around noonish, having only had coffee and a donut for breakfast. The bus let up off just down the street from Independence Hall, so I checked it and the Liberty Bell out first before heading to 8th Street to catch the 47 bus to Passyunk.  There they both were, Pat's and Geno's, standing opposite each other like two pro wrestlers waiting to take each other apart. Being a purist, I hit Pat's first. I've heard horror stories about mile-long lines, but being that this was 1:30pm on a Thursday, there was only one person ahead of me and being that I don't mix milchdik & fleishdik, I ordered a steak wit (onions) ($10.00 wit tax) and grabbed a green, orange and red cherry pepper as a side.  If you don't know about cherry peppers, here's some advice: The red ones, counter-intuitively, are sweet with a nice little kick of heat. The orange ones are hotter and the green ones, if you can't take the heat, you should avoid. Fortunately, I like heat. They were certainly generous enough with the meat, which, while a bit on the greasy side, was tender and flavorful. The bread was nice and chewy enough to hold up to the meat, but it was obviously very fresh. Having skipped breakfast and being subjected to a two-hour bus ride and brief historical tour, I still had room after my Pat's steak to try the upstart newcomer, so I dodged traffic and headed across the street to Geno's, where I ordered the same steak with onions and no cheese  (also $10.00 wit tax). Unlike Pat's, where they slice and chop their meat, Geno's slices and grills, which may be why their meat, in comparison was so dry and tasteless. The difference between Pat's and Geno's was so obvious that I dodged traffic a second time and bought two more to take back to Brooklyn ""wit"" me. In my humble opinion, in the war between Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's, Pat's wins hands-down.

We went when there was no line (about 11pm) and they were still pretty impatient. It's interesting that both places serve the same items (for same high prices) and they treat the customers the same. I believe there is no rivalry. In fact, they're probably family and use the rivalry to boost sales at each location. Anyhow, as far as the food goes, Pat's is better. Their bread is better and their meat is not as dry at Geno's. Pat's French fries are also hands down better. Overall it was a cool experience. You rarely find places that are borderline rude to their customers and people still line up to eat there. One of the things I found off putting were the prices.

Since Geno's and Pat's are just across from each other, I ordered a cheesesteak from each place with a bottled water and chomped away.  The bread: -- Bread from Pat's was way too tough/. Not only did I have to bite into the bread, but I had to literally tear the bread in order to take any bites. The bread from Geno's was way easier to tolerate.  The steak: -- The portion of meat from Geno's was much smaller than Pat's. Also, the meat from Pat's was much more seasoned. I'm not sure if Geno's seasons their meat with anything 'cause it basically tasted like unseasoned roast beef.   The filling: -- I got Whiz With (with cheese whiz and with onions) at both places. I liked Geno's onions better, but the whiz was better from Pat's since Geno's was very skimpy on the whiz. The whiz is easily visible on the Pat's cheesesteak, but Geno's put a VERY TINY amount at the bottom of their cheesesteak. I almost went back to ask if they had forgotten to put it on.  The price: -- It's same at both places. $8.25 for cheesesteak.  ***CASH ONLY***  Service: -- Service at both locations sucked big time. I guess it's part of the whole ""lure"" to be rude and even curse at the customers. But I am not into this whole dumb idea of  ""Hahhahaa. I just got cursed at at a tourist trap. I can't wait to post it on Facebook and Twitter!""  I still expect people to be nice, especially people who are servicing customers.  Personally, both places sucked. The food wasn't all that bad but it wasn't anything close to what I was expecting. I expected more flavor, more meat, more cheese, and most importantly, more taste.

We went a bit before noon, and parking wasn't as bad as I expected- it is all street parking, but we managed to get a spot only a block away. There wasn't much of a line by the time we got there, but when we were leaving around 12:10/12:15, a line was already forming.  The decor is pretty tacky, to say the least. The service guys all seemed like they were smirking at you, but we got all our food in about 30 seconds, which was pretty impressive. The racist signs around the place were pretty off-putting, and I think they should really reconsider that- after reading the signs, I'd be really hesitant to ever go back (for example: ""Press 1 for English, press 2 for deporation""). There's really a line between patriotism and ignorance, and Geno's managed to cross incredibly far into ignorance.  We ordered cheese fries, a diet coke and a cheesesteak with American cheese and onions. The ordering system was a bit confusing- there were different windows for different things (i.e. order the cheesesteak at one window, pay, then move to a different window to order the fries, pay, etc.) and the signage wasn't clear. The cheesesteak was $9, which was prettttty steep. The meat on the cheesesteak was gray-ish, and were cut into long slices. The onions were large-ish chunks, and not really cooked well. The roll was so greasy that looked wet, and the bread on one end actually was wet from grease. We had to get napkins and blot it off, and we went through a good number of napkins before we felt the cheesesteak was digestible. The American cheese, however, was tasty. The cheesefries were mostly just fries with some cheez whiz on it, and weren't too bad- although all the cheese whiz sunk to the bottom, so the top didn't really have much on it and the bottom had so much that the fries were stuck together.

My wife discovered Geno's after some Google research of some of the best places to eat.  We tried Geno's and Pat's the same evening and all seemed to enjoy Geno's more.  We ordered cheesesteak, wit, wiz....aka a cheesesteak with onion and Cheese Whiz which we understand to be the definition of a cheesesteak.  We also ordered regular and cheesefries.    Despite enjoying Geno's more, none of the five of us were impressed with  Philadelphia cheesesteaks.  They lacked flavor.  It was like eating unmarinated meat, onion, and bread covered in cheese.  I've had better cheesesteaks at other places around the country so it was a bit disappointing this was the standard that everyone references for cheesesteaks.  My son said if we ever return to Philadelphia, that he doesn't want a cheesesteak...and I think the rest of the family agrees.  Parking was problematic as there is nothing besides street parking and it was chaotic when we arrived.  There was a guy trying to make a few bucks who was directing traffic and said he would watch our car.  We returned and he was nowhere to be found but we sat nearby to watch the car as we didn't park in a proper spot.  A cop passed talking on his cell phone and didn't blink an eye so we figured we were alright.    Geno's seems much more efficient, modern, and friendlier than Pat's so I'll give them kudos there.",0,"tZ5U0noloIyw_1I0m5qAfw"

I understand supporting cops killed in action but why the need to prominently display the killer's obviously Muslim-sounding name. To me, the reason was obvious, especially in conjunction with the other sign.  So not only does their cheese-steak suck. But their morals do as well. I'll pass.",6,"2mXFxZKJsbKvOWtO1lK8dQ"

Result?  INCONCLUSIVE.  Pat's - Pros: - Lots & lots of cheese whiz. - Thick(er), delicious pizza fries. - Better, softer, hoagie. - Cheesesteak add-ons such as mushrooms, peppers, and pizza sauce.  Pat's - Cons: - Dirtier.  No pretty tables or clean condiment bar. - Ruder service.  If you don't get the ordering system right, you got to move to the back of the line.  Geno's - Pros: - Thicker slices of meat. - Stronger onion flavour. - Clean restaurant decorated in bright orange colours. - Neon-lit environment.  Like the Boardwalk! - Nice service.  They actually wrap and bag your sandwich.  At Pat's, they throw it at you on a piece of wax paper.  Geno's - Cons: - Not as much cheese.  Less cheese, less fun! - Thin, McDonald-esqe fries.  Again, less cheese. - Lack of cheesesteak toppings - no mushrooms, peppers, pizza sauce, or anything else.  Overall: Better Food: Pat's! Better Experience: Geno's!  Other tips: - Only outdoor seating at both places, so be prepared to sacrifice the tips of your fingers to frostbite during the colder months.  Or, alternatively, order to go. - Learn how to order.  First, specify what cheese (cheese whiz - the classic!, American, or provolone) you want.  Second, specify whether or not you want onions. For example, ""whiz with"" translates into ""cheesesteak with cheese whiz with onions"".  At Pat's, tack on the toppings you want following your order. - Geno's & Pat's are probably tourist traps.

Only the photos are different.  What's more, I was fairly unimpressed with either place.  I was introduced to Pat's and Geno's in Rick Sebak's 2002 PBS documentary, Sandwiches That You Will Like.  Well, the cheesesteak at these two places I can't really say I liked.  I had a ""provolone wit"" (i.e., cheesesteak sandwich with provolone cheese and grilled onions).  The bread was stale and the cheese not melted.  Frankly, I've had better cheesesteaks at the mall in Albuquerque (seriously!).  For a better cheesesteak in the Philly area, try Dalessandro's.  Or skip the cheesesteak and get a fantastic hoagie at Primo's!!! .... Maybe I should've had it with whiz.  Of all the Rick Sebak documented sandwiches, Pat's and Geno's have been the only disappointments as of yet.  Still, these are both institutions in their own right, so I'm glad I came --- only because now I can say I've been here.  Oh, and be prepared for ridiculously long lines and a long walk to find parking.  There is no indoor seating.  Tables outside only (if you can find a free table).  Also (and I don't mean this as a criticism) if you're not from the area, you may perceive employees' manner as rude.  It really isn't.  It's just part of the South Philly 'tude.  Just roll wit it.

You can see about 20 pounds of meat pre-cooking.  That's right -- Your steak is not made to order.  Boo!  The bread is boring and bland.  The actual size of the sandwich isn't that big comparatively.  It also tastes much worse than better options.  The hot sauce available at the sidewalk stand is pretty hot and good though.  Do you speak English?  Good, because that's the only language allowed here.  Plus the delivery is downright obnoxious.  There's really no need to go here unless you want to say you've been to Geno's.  The best part of Geno's, like Pat's, is that they are open 24/7.  So if it's overnight and you REALLY need a steak, you can always come here.",3,"yOwhHlVx8inDWEeo9t4GBQ"

Geno's clearly uses their reputation to get away with using only cheap/ low quality ingredients. It was not made fresh and was ready and wrapped in less than 3 minutes- essentially cold.

Geno's, having the longer line, we decided to try first. Upon approaching the ordering window we were faced with inappropriate, racist, political statements sponsored by the founder of Geno's himself. ""This is America, order in English!"" ""I want my country back."" Not only is it offensive, but ignorant as well, as the United States has no official language. While it is an English speaking establishment, and it may be more polite to order in English, they do not have to make such a statement about it. The whole thing made me not want to order from there at all.  The most important part, however, is the taste. After picking up a second cheesesteak from Pat's, we sat down across the street and took our first bites. My girlfriend had the Pat's cheesesteak; I had the one from Geno's. Her immediate response was, ""Mmm..."" Mine was, ""eh."" So we traded sandwiches and this bite had flavor.   As other reviews had stated, the steak is dry, flavorless, as is the bread itself.

We decide to hit Geno's first.  Juliet volunteers to order, having boned up on proper etiquette. There is a window for cheese steaks, and another window for drinks and fries. While she waits in the longer line, I acquire a Birch Beer and some cheese fries. Signs in the windows proclaim Geno's support for Trump in the next Presidential race; warnings if you don't speak English or you don't order correctly; and plenty of star-spangled banners. It feels like I'm at a Tea Party rally.  With a bit of luck and patience, we secure a small picnic table and unveil the beast. We tear the foot long in half, then dig in. The bread is soft; the shaved meat is juicy; the onions are sweet, weeping; and the Cheese Whiz is...well, Cheese Whiz. In the end, it is nothing special, just a somewhat thin sub with some anemic, salty, and overly-processed ingredients. The Birch Beer does wonders to wash it down. The cheese fries are pretty good, though. Better than the sandwich.  Eager to work our way up the food chain, we cross the street and prepare for Pat's. I step up this time to order, paying close attention to the instructions printed next to the window. I say, ""One provolone wit"". Translation: ""One cheesesteak with provolone cheese and with onions."" I feel like a local when the guy takes my money, hands back the change, and another guy shoves a sub at me. I'm getting the hang of this!  Unfortunately, there are no available seats. People are like scavengers, rushing to the nearest open picnic table and wolfing down their late lunches. We end up at one of the standing rails, clustered close together against the brisk wind. The sandwich tears apart easily. I take my first bite and prepare for the onslaught of meat and cheese...only to be met with nothing. Nada. Zip. Bupkis. I don't taste bread, meat, onions, or cheese. What in tarnation?  I eat more slowly, rolling each bite around on my tongue, trying to tease the flavors out. Still, it eludes me. The preparation is either too light a touch, or Geno's has ruined me. Maybe that's their secret weapon: ruin your taste buds before you try the competition.  But don't take my word for it.

Wanting to sample some good ol' Philly Cheesesteak, Samyar recommended one of the two best in Philly: Geno's. So, we made our way to the bright orange, neon signs that made Geno's easily seen from any direction.  Type of cuisine: ""Geno's Steaks was started by Joe Vento back in 1966. He figured that if he was going to sell a steak, he had to be where they were already eating them...at the ""X"" shaped intersection of 9th & Passyunk in South Philadelphia. Joe learned the cheese steak business from his father who in the early 1940's opened ""Jim's Steaks"". In 1966, Joe started ""Geno's"" with $6.00 in his pocket, 2 boxes of steaks and some hot dogs."" According to their website, ""The ingredients are simple, exacting and never greasy thinly sliced rib-eye steak, melted cheese, oven-fresh baked bread and delicately grilled onions. Awaiting your piping hot sandwich on the counter outside are ketchup, mustard, relish and Joe's choice hot sauce.""   Ambiance: Good thing we were warned while standing in the street, in line for our orders. Samyar let us know that we say, ""One with...(fill in the blank with type of cheese between Provolone, American or Cheese Whiz) and with onions (or without)."" Writing this, now, I also see that Geno's has also enlighted it's website readers, ""Be prepared and know how to order, because the service is fast and the line keeps moving. For example, on a cheese steak with onions, specifiy which kind of cheese you'd like. By the time you have given your order, your money will be taken and your sandwich will e out the window nice and hot! At the next window you can pick up your soda, fries and coffee."" This is no joke! Walking up to the eccentric, slightly overboard signage denoting Geno's from blocks away, over the fenced field housing a community garden, one is immediately inundated with orange. The chest-height, glossy, orange-tiled walls with a blue-tiled stripe, the awning overhead noting: ""Geno's Welcomes You!"" and the orange, plastic picnic tables attached to metallic pillars with an orange cover cannot go unnoticed. While there is no indoor dining, these casual tables find themselves under a canopy on the sidewalk ""for those who wish to enjoy sandwiches on the premises rather than drive off with them"". The condiment bar, a large, chest-height, metal box with an opening on the side facing the order windows, offers Cherry Peppers, Ketchup, Mustard and Relish.  Large, locked, glass display cases include badges which ornamented civil service members throughout the years. Everywhere from the walls above the orange tiles to the ceiling can be seen such memorabilia, including plaques in memory and honor of. A Path of Honor lays the foundation in the brick tile-work that leads to the ordering windows from the street corner, in between orange horse-heads set atop metal pillars chained to one another. As we watch, hawk-eyed for a spot at the orange tables, we find one at the far end, closest to the ordering line, and snag it while no one else is paying attention.  At the table, on the table, we see numerous photographs, set like a collage, underneath a thick, plexi-glass table surface. Our sandwiches, wrapped in wax paper with the Geno's logo, immediately in front of us, awaiting the first bite.  What I ordered: I ordered ""One with Provolone and onions."" Chris seconded. Samyar selected ""One with American and onions."" (Each sandwich: Price $8.33, Tax $0.67, Total: $9.) At the next window, we also placed two orders for Cheese Fries ($4.60 plus $0.40 tax, for a total of $5), a rounded container of thin-cut fries drenched in Cheese Whiz.  What I loved: I loved the cherry peppers at the condiment bar, fluffy, juicy and just spicy enough to give a kick, without numbing your taste buds. I also loved the relish, surprisingly. I have never been a fan of relish, especially store-bought, pre-packaged. This relish had larger cut pickles and less of a sweet flavor. I enjoyed the salty, tangy taste of the pickles with the otherwise, slightly dry sandwich.  Why I loved it: The bright orange, the casual atmosphere, the large bikers with tattoos the size of my head on each arm working the kitchen line and the scruff woman at the register snapping our orders across the room behind the plexiglass separating us from them, inside.  Cost: High ($9 per sandwich, sides extra)",0,"JEPDG3TLwqOQTPztScdeSA"

I had the sandwich with provolone, husband had the sandwich with cheez whiz, and we shared the fries with cheez whiz on top. The meat in my sandwich was dry, tasteless, and rubbery and I could barely taste the provolone. Husband's sandwich kept dripping greasy liquid that I guessed was from the cheez whiz. The cheese on the fries had already congealed by the time we brought it over to the table, so it was just a huge clump.  Husband and I suffered stomach pains and spent the rest of the night taking turns in the bathroom. I only felt queasy the day after, but husband still had cramps and diarrhea.  I assumed it must be the cheez whiz that caused the cramps and diarrhea, because I only ate a few of the fries and I didn't have it as bad.

You can watch the cooks grilling inside the restaurant in a methodical, repetitive motion: cook the steak, spray the oil, keep it warm, cheese whiz the bread, caramelize onions over and over and over again.

We ended up at Geno's because the spot that my friend (a recent Philly transplant) wanted to take us to closed before we could make it. When we arrived business was booming - we thought we were in the right place! I ordered a pepper cheesesteak with provolone and my boyfriend ordered a mushroom cheesesteak with provolone.  It wasn't until we placed our order that we found out that the meat isn't seasoned. Yeah, that's right - they're just throwing frozen ribeye on the grill for a few minutes and throwing it on your bun. No salt, no pepper, no nothing. The cashier was visibly offended that we would even ask! He said that they don't ""ruin the flavor of the ribeye with seasoning"". Now from what I know of steak, it doesn't taste like anything but what you season it with. But I'm like ""hey, maybe they have some magic ribeye"". I was hoping the peppers and onions would add some flavor...WRONG! We were given our food very quickly - it came out in less than five minutes. I took a bite only to discover what I'd feared - the sandwich had no freaking flavor! Never in all my days have I been served unseasoned steak! Luckily, there's a condiment hub with salt, pepper, ketchup, etc. I doused my sandwich with salt and pepper just to make it edible...I paid 10 bucks for a foot long and no fries...I was gonna make a way lol.  Bottom line is this - I ate wayyyy better food at the Caribbean food spot (Ron's Caribbean Cuisine, if you're wondering) and even the bodega. It should be a crime not to season meat. Like, a felony. I don't know if it's a melanin thing (I'm black, y'all) but we don't play like that. I'm currently on the porcelain trying to expel this waste from stomach and hopefully my memory.

Before I start, I want to mention that I'm from Arizona, and before coming to Philly, I have never had a cheesesteak before in my life. I'm not a huge fan of steak/roast beef/red meat sandwiches, so essentially I never really got around to trying an authentic cheesesteak (and being from Phoenix, a mediocre one at that). But I decided, When in Rome, and saved my first ever cheesesteak experiences for my first ever trip to Philly.  Me being me, I had to try a steak from both Pat's and Geno's to compare. From all the people I survey, the favor between Pat's and Geno's is a pretty stark 50/50. So how could I try one without the other? Answer: I can't. Our first steak was from Geno's, and it was pretty good. However, I enjoyed the steak from Pat's significantly more. The cheesefries here, though, are seriously awesome.   In my personal opinion, the cheesesteak here was a bit too dry. I don't know if it was the steak itself, or just from a lack of Wiz. Also, the steak here was a bit less flavorful. That doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable though.   As every reviewer posts it is cash only, and expect to pay around $10 per person for a steak, drink and cheese fries/fries. Additionally, don't expect stellar service from the staff either. I found that the service at Geno's, though, was much friendlier than the service at Pat's. Especially the older gentleman who was working the fries/drinks window that particular day. However, they get you in and they get you out. Other than that, you're not gonna get much more. But in an odd way, I liked the brief and short interaction with employees; a reflection of that rough around the edges Philly/East Coast charm that I was so unaccustomed to.  I'm sure there are much better cheesesteaks around, but for my first cheesesteak experience, I have to say I am impressed. Granted, we went for more of the tourist experience, but it was still enjoyable from a diner's standpoint.",2,"lX84alrS89AFMWcRtyu4Ow"

We rode through New York city and down the Jersey Turnpike -- the monotony of the highway and the growl of the motor causing a constant mental struggle between concentration and the visions of thinly sliced ribeye, warm bread, onions, and of course melted cheese.  The clouds were rolling in as we arrived in the city and parked the bikes next to the landmark Philadelphia tradition known as Geno's Steaks, and walked to the counter.  Undaunted by the light rain that started to fall, we each polished off the sandwich we had been craving.  The ordering here is ridiculously fast paced -- the service (while polite and kind) was more interested in efficiency than small-talk, and you can understand why as the line only grew as the clouds rolled in.  The sandwich itself, topped with american, provolone, or ""whiz"" was served hot and fast -- the bread still warm, and the steak tender and juicy -- but not greasy.  As the sky grew darker we knew it was time to depart, but before we did we packed another two sandwiches into the saddlebags... you know... in case we got hungry again.  The only drawback to the trip was the ride home -- ultimately we beat the weather (though literally by seconds).  I learned quickly that the combination of empty stomach + copious amounts of hot beef and cheese + the constant vibration of ones abdomen on a bike did not make for the most comfortable trip.

To me, a philly cheesesteak goes with a liquid cheese and since they don't have liquid American like Steves (Phillys 2nd best steak), whiz it is.

I was pretty eager to try out an authentic Philly Cheeseteak to see how it matches up with the one local to me back in Cali.  First off, the line was wrapped around the block, but the best part was the the line moved very quickly.  You get to the window and blurt out your sandwich order and pay 10 bucks to the lady.  The sandwich came in 3 minutes, then if you want a drink you have to move down to the next window to order the rest of your meal.

The bread was tough and chewy inside and out without a hint of toasting or crisp on the outside.  Meat was pretty bland and was in small pieces like getting the last of a bag of chips.  The only thing I could really taste was the provolone cheese.   In short, tasted like a microwaved frozen sandwich.  Also got a LARGE soda, which was about 12 oz or so.  I know we americans are overweight, but a Large is a large..and it should be about 20 oz-24 oz minumum esp if you're paying top prices.      Lastly, also had an order of fries for 4 dollars!! yes $$$$4 DOLLARS!!! Fries are served in a paper cup and look like seasoned fries but aren't so it makes me wonder what kind of oil they use.  Ate the first fry and I immediately had that nasty oil/film coating left in my mouth.

Even Food Network has done a special on this topic. To not spoil the fun, I won't disclose the outcome.  So, diving right into this I can say that you have to ""understand"" Philly cheesesteak to ""get"" what Geno's is going for. The steaks are shaven, cooked with onions in large batches on a flat top surface. So they steep in their own juices and absorb the onion flavor.   For those who have never had Philly cheesesteak, the prospect of topping off your sandwich with cheese wiz can be a sacrilege. Rest assured, this is how Joey Vento has made his sandwich for decades. This is the one time you may excuse yourself for indulging in pseudo-cheese.   I guess the reason I'm a fan of this place is more because of its history and its unabashed patriotism. Prominently displayed on their windows is Vento proclaiming ""This is America, when ordering 'speak english'."" If you get turned off by his political stance, then I suppose you would have no reason to eat his sandwiches. In other words, don't expect a gourmet experience here. Instead, this is more of a spot for you to check in on Yelp just so that you can say ""Hey, I've been there.""  Yes, it's pretty difficult to review a place that's popular not so much because of its food, but because of its history.  Not sure why this place is called ""Geno's"" even though the founder's name is Joey Vento. Maybe Geno is short for his full name?",2,"_A8Gf7sJVkK1seAIWRVAcg"

The cheesesteaks (and fries and drinks) are a bit overpriced, the rudeness and bigotry (""English speakers only"") are off-putting, and the huge collection of law-enforcement patches are, with the most cynical interpretation, a disturbing ode to authoritarian establishment such as is rarely seen.  A possible plus is that, while Geno's aways seems somewhat busy, I didn't have to wait in a long line to eat (unlike Jim's, where I had to wait an hour). The cheesesteak itself, while enjoyable, was not as otherworldly as some might claim, and others might expect.    Despite all of that, I have to admit that I enjoy the gaudiness of the neon and the bright-as-day lights that come on at night. There is a certain ""fun"" quality to this place, and it attracts all sorts of people (the locals, the tourists, the young, the old, the panhandlers; I even saw ""Santa"" here once during the Christmas season, eating a cheesesteak after a hard day's work, still in full costume).   Geno's is not a place to come if you want a good value, or great food. It doesn't earn the amount of business it gets through taste, quality, or service. The draw of Geno's (somewhat tenuous) claims to history or authenticity are largely countered by its Disneyland-esque fakeness. But I would say it's worth visiting once, seeing the lights at night, trying a cheesesteak ""wit provolone and onions,"" comparing it to the one found across the street at Pat's and enjoying the uniquely Philadelphian experience.",0,"ROg3A39AKZ_7OrPlTUoWYw"

First Parking is a waiting game and limited. You eat outside or order to go. It was in winter time low 20's so it was freezing cold over there. We had already driven out of our way over there so we were going to try those sandwiches. We finally found short term parking right on the side and got off and ordered. The senior woman takes our order didn't even greet or smile it was more like ""what do you want"" type of attitude. I was like okay whatever i can understand you hate life you work at a cheesesteak shop and would like to retire and go relax. I get it. I ignore the rudeness and pay $20 some odd dollars for two sandwiches and silently think to myself i should have gone to the phillysteak shop across the street instead of this one.  Anyway We wait and we are freezing we dont even sit down. She looks at me and calls me over and hands me two sandwiches and says you want theirs too and looks at a non caucasian group of people that must've ordered before us. I looked confused and said ""no i want ours"". She says oh i thought you were part of them, one sec. She closes the window and says something to the guys preparing sandwiches and one of the guys smiles looking at me through the window in disbelief of what she said. He knew she had showed her racist card. I was confused because there were several other couples that had ordered before and after us too. I was like, really you geriatric racist?! She just assumed and grouped everyone that wasn't caucasian in a group. Mind you the other couple wasn't even hispanic they were afro-american and we weren't even standing close to each other. The other group looked at us and were just as confused. The whole thing was fkt.  I felt weird after and was trying to forget about it and not let it ruin the sandwich experience. We opened our sandwiches and it didn't look special.  I ordered an original with everything the taste was mediocre it was not flavorful the bread was def not fresh and the sandwich was compareable to fair food. A dry sandwich with tuff dry bread and with flavorless meat. We were hungry so we ate it. We couldn't finish it standing outside in the freezing cold so we found a canoli place right next door and we sat down in there. We were attended very well by that little cozy cafe and served excellent hot chocolate which turned our whole experience around.

They were shell shocked and forgot about the food.    First, the food is awesome! Never once been disappointed.  Well, once perhaps, I did only get one sandwich just to start eating it and have second thoughts and ate that one while I got back in line for another!!!!!  Now a couple of free tips for the noobs who come by to make your experience better.   This is not McDonalds. This place during the rush hour times will have a line down the block.  Be prepared for a line.  It's worth it, that's why everyone is there.    Do yourself (and the rest of us) a favor.  Take a look at the menu way ahead of time and figure out what you want.  Like right after you read this review., then before you walk up and get in line.  Make sure you know not only what you want but what everyone in your group wants as well.  How they want their cheesesteak.  What type cheese, with or without onions.   Knowing all this in advance will make your order go faster and easier.   If you make the Geno's crew happy guess what, they make happy Food and that makes us happy.  (Don't make them angry, nobody likes angry Food LOL!)   Don't forget to bring cash...and enough of it.    As for seating, it's very limited and outside.   Going back to the car if you drove there in might be a better idea.    Speaking of car, remember I spoke about the rush...finding a place to park can be rough too.  Expect that.  No waltzing in and parking and walking right up to the window unless you are the Mayor or Governor or something....and even then ;-)   Keep some of these tips in mind and perhaps go the extra mile and watch a YouTube video on Geno's and you will have a proper expectation and be prepared on how to focus on enjoying the great food you are going to get and not hung up about other stuff.

Tommy DiNic's 2, Geno's Steaks 3. Pat's King of Steaks 4. Carmen's Famous Italian Hoagie  Located in south Philly...........finding Geno's wasn't too hard for me, but finding parking to get to Geno's was the biggest challenge! There is no private parking for this place, so you have to roll the dice & hopefully find some metered street parking. Lucky for me, I was able to find some street parking that wasn't too far, so I was able to hit up both Geno's & Pat's at the same time, as both rival business are just across from each other.  When you walk up to the ordering counter, make sure you're ready to order your cheesesteak as they like to keep the line moving.............there is only outside seating, as this place is like a grab & go kinda place.  Upon ordering, I ended up getting my cheesesteak sandwich with American cheeese & onions. Just a tip gang............don't do the American cheese, get the Wiz instead.......as that's the real way of eating a cheesesteak sandwich! I also noticed Geno's cuts their meat in whole slices, vs. Pat's that cuts up their meat in small little pieces.  What can I say about my sandwich? The bun was good, but the meat was rather on the dry and chewy side...........I was thinking to myself - ""what is all the hype about this place?"" Granted, I am not a Philly cheesesteak connoisseur...........but I know what I like as far as taste, and Geno's was just okay for me.   I know Geno's has been around for a long time (founded in 1966 by Joey Vento), so I'm sure they have their loyal fans.

I will be fair, the one and ONLY good thing that was worth mentioning, the steak was of good quality and fairly tender, BUT it was not cut thin enough.  Cheese whiz is cheese whiz, but they did not put enough on it.  The onions were diced a bit too small, and not cooked enough.  The bread wasn't bad, but wasn't that good either, tasted like something you'd be in a supermarkets bread aisle (do not mistake this comment for a supermarkets fresh bakery)  The cheesesteaks are $8.50, I wouldn't have said it was overpriced if it was good, but it was not!  There is only outdoor seating, outdoor ordering, outdoor eating, does not have an inside! It's the type of building that should be on a boardwalk, not in the middle a northest metro area!  They do not offer mayo with the condiments. The hot sauce that they offer is insanely hot, too hot for a cheesesteak IMO, and this is the only hot sauce they have....

The first thing I noted was that at Geno's my cheese steak came neatly as well as fully wrapped, whereas at Pat's it always came open. Though they say the bread is the same, Italian loaf, at both establishments they do come from different bakeries, hence are really not identical. For bread, I sort of preferred Pat's which seemed more mushy, but for the meat and overall ingredient taste, I preferred Gino's as it was seemingly the less greasy of the two, the flavors better saturated into the mix and Gino's completely void of any grizzle. Both are, however, very good, but my preference would be for Geno's which I am likewise rating at Four Stars.

The way the employees seem to resent their customers for bothering them by patronizing their establishment, and especially  the obese man/woman character who slices the bread for the sandwiches complete the carnie vibe.  I'd give the food a C-, and definitely not worth the $9 or whatever it is they charge now. For my two cents, it is better than Pat's, whose meat I find to be dry and undigestible. To be sure, you will get a better steak from ANY other sandwich shop in Philly (besides Pat's) or any other city for that matter.  There is something humbling about going to Geno's. Usually when I'm there it's at an hour when most decent people are asleep (Geno's is open 24hrs). You get into a long line with money in hand, for fear of not being prepared to get out of the cashier's sight the moment they shove your overpriced pile of meat in your hand. Then there's the ridiculous streamlined ordering system (the ""wiz wit or witout"" shit) which I suppose originated naturally by regulars, but now feels contrived because it is mandatory. I want to gag sometimes when I hear myself say it. You slink off, happy to be out of eye-shot of the miserable people making sandwiches inside.   Then there's Mr. Geno's steaks himself, Joey Vento. A real-life Jed Clampett, Mr. Vento comes off as a lovable lug who made it big. He seems like a nice guy, aside from his divisive political views which he has no qualms about sharing. That doesn't bother me. I imagine that if Jed Clampett went on a racist tirade about terrorists and Middle Eastern Oil, he'd be forgiven on the grounds of being a rich, overindulged rube, too.  Yet another aspect of Geno's that is in bad taste is the police and firefighter theme. Being a person who hates cops, and ESPECIALLY over-the-top, tasteless pandering, this really gets me. There is a giant plaque of Daniel Faulkner's surly mug (cop who was allegedly killed by Mumia Abu Jamal 30 years ago) right out front.   As if this wasn't enough to dissuade anyone from going to Geno's, consider the case of the gentleman who was beaten up by Geno's goons after discovering meat delivered surreptitiously in the middle of the night was labeled as coming from some South American country from a year previous. Granted, he got beaten up for keying Geno's Hummer, but he discovered year old meat from a different continent all the same. Go America",12,"xHzU9LKwxGHq7BNPA16gog"

After trying both, I'm at a draw - here's my two cents to the pot.  Of the two, this place really stands out because of the flashy neon lights advertising their corner, the large lit-up picture of a cheesesteak that looked almost Photoshopped in the pictures I took, and the almost daylight brightness of the sitting area that makes eating there seem like the daytime no matter when you actually go.    I actually liked the flavor of Geno's cheese steaks better than Pat's.  You can actually taste the sliced steak and sauteed onions without being overpowered with too much Cheez-Wiz unlike some other places. I can actually taste the meaty fattiness of the steak and the biting sweetness of the freshly sauteed onions, accentuated with just the right amount of cheesy-saltiness.  While the bread was chewier and didn't ""melt"" into the rest of the cheesesteak ingredients, the ratio of bread to filling was perfect to taste the fattiness/sweetness/saltiness blending into the mild flavor of the bread.  Unfortunately Geno's doesn't offer any other fillings (i.e. mushrooms, green peppers) but what they do offer does the job well.  Beyond the Cheez-Wiz on the cheese fries, the fries were bland and unimpressive.  Go to Pat's if you want good cheese fries.    Overall I'm at a loss at which place is better than the other.  Regardless of which one I end up at they each have attributes that make for good cheesesteaks, though they have other attributes that make them fall short in satisfying the hunger for the perfect sammich.  Perhaps I need to try the provolone cheesesteaks here for better evaluation and comparison.",3,"FZQXGfmkMASFWq3JnuQZqg"

(My personal ranking: 1.Jim's 2.Tony Luke's 3.Pat's 4.Geno's)  There should only be one reason why you ever eat a cheesesteak from Geno's, and that's if you never tried it before. You deserve a slap on the hand if you ever consider eating at Geno's again.   CONS: 1. The meat is not chopped up 2. There is no seasoning on the meat what-so-ever 3. The whiz is not hot enough 4. The overall taste is bland 5. The cheesesteak, as if it can get any worse, loses more and more flavor as you eat it  PRO: 1. The bread is slightly softer than Pat's 2. The cheesesteak is slightly warmer than Pat's  A WARNING TO ALL FIRST TIMERS: This establishment is Pro-American. My boyfriend (who by the way is Filipino-American, born and raised in Jersey just like me) heard someone at the window say to another employee, ""no no they're american"" after we ordered our food.

So, we walk over to the stands (they're not restaurants.. just stands where you order food) get in line at Geno's (which for some odd reason stretches into the middle of the street; the line that is) the wait was about the same as it was at Pat's approx 10 minutes which wasn't bad for a ""tourist trap"" food stand. The service was here was somewhat better, the yelling was kept to a minimun. Once we ordered we stood on the counter space and ate there. We got a ""wit american"" sandwich which was pretty bad... the meat was under seasoned (i see a pattern between the two places) the cheese was ok (at least it was melted), the bread was hard unpleasant. So what makes this a one star and the place across the street a two star? Well for one, we didn't see ROACHES crawling up and down the wall of Pat's like we did here, nor was the other stand littered with trash up and down it's sides. Overall, the whole experience was very disappointing, after all the talk and hoopla about this place it truly wasn't anything special. People say ""well you go there for the experience"" what experience are they talking about? horrible parking, bad smells, rude people, mediocre food & ROACHES?",1,"jP3iw9m6y-Qi8CWF9Z5MqA"

While many debate the best cheesesteaks in Philly, my personal perference is the ultra-American Geno's.  One thing that I love about Geno's is the hours of operation.  Given that I went on New Years Eve, one might expect Geno's to be closed, especially given the fact that the cross-street rival Pat's was not serving.  Instead, the hardworking Geno's staff is open 24/7/365, ensuring that I can always get my favorite cheesesteak and that the neighborhood is always aglow thanks to the massive neon signs adorning the outside of this landmark spot.  Although the lines tend to differ depending on when you go, we hit a peak time and the line wrapped partway around the block.  However, the system of serving up the cheesesteaks helps the line move along at a rapid pace so it only took us about 25 minutes to get to the window.  Upon arriving at the window, you notice the bumper stickers they have posted illustrating their support for police, ordering in English, and contempt for anything un-American.  The  establishment is cash only and they prefer you to order a specific way, stating simply the type of cheese first and then ""wit"" or ""witout"" onions.  Thats it.  Don't bother asking for mushrooms, lettuce, or any other silly condiments on a true Philly cheesesteak.  You can, however, add a few limited condiments yourself after getting your food.  The service is not exceptionally welcoming, but the setup is built to get the customer their food promptly so that is not a major detractor.  Geno's is also a cash-only place, so don't expect to come with just a credit card in hand.  The variety on the menu is limited to cheesesteaks and roast pork sandwiches with fries, cheese fries and sodas available at a separate window, but come on, when your going to Geno's, everyone is getting a cheesesteak.  The prices are not cheap, with a cheesesteak costing $8.50 and a cup of cheese fries putting you back $4.50.    I ordered a cup of cheese fries to eat while waiting in line.  Given our hunger and the thick coating of cheese, we downed these in no time.  I cannot tell for sure if it was my hunger and anticipation but I felt that the fries were great.  We then went on to order our cheesesteaks, her getting a Whiz With, while I ordered a Whiz Without.  One thing I love about Geno's Steaks is the fact that they offer whiz, a cheese that too few restaurants offer outside of Philly.  The cheese was nice and gooey like whiz should be and though it could have stood to be a little heavier on the cheese, the mixture of cheese, bread, and meat really worked.  Although I do not usually like grilled onions, Geno's makes it work well on the cheesesteak.  The onions were placed on the grill but hardly grilled giving them a nice crunch that worked well on the cheesesteak.  The meat was well prepared using nice, thinly sliced ribeye pieces (not chopped up though) with a little bit of fat on it to give it some juice and flavor.      The bread was the biggest difference between a Philly cheesesteak and a cheesesteak from elsewhere.  Delivered from up the street, the amoroso rolls they use do not overpower the sandwich by being too thick but instead offer a soft roll that is at the same time firm enough to handle the cheesesteak.  The sandwich really comes together with a perfect blend of meat, cheese, and a terrific bread roll.  Everyone has their favorite cheesesteak place, but mine is definitely Geno's topping its cross-street rival Pat's King of Steaks.  That being said, look for blog reports on some of the other well known Philly cheesesteak joints in the future.

First, the language issue.  I'm old enough to remember walking into many a Philadelphia corner pizza places as a kid in the 80s and hearing Italian spoken by just about everyone. Vento's grandparents no doubt did the same, at least for a while.  I've also had the fortune of working in the language business and living in Southern California for quite a while.  I've never met a second generation American of a Spanish-speaking background that does not speak English. It's the way things work, no immigrant group has come to the US with a widespread command of the English language.  I've seen no proof to demonstrate that today's Latino immigrants are learning English any slower than yesterday's Italian immigrants. The posturing by Geno's is bigoted towards those people they aren't especially fond of.  They aren't worthy of my business any longer.  Second would be their status as an ""infamous"" cheesesteak spot.  Geno's had very little fame before the Food Network existed and if you judge by the many disappointed reviews out out-of-towners, it's been a disgrace to this fine sandwich. While they use good non-processed meat (though the pressed stuff has its place!), they take the same sort of express approach you see at Pats where your order is ready before you're done speaking- cheese still cold and stiff.  Add to that a considerable dose of canned rudeness and you'll be looking for a Plan B for lunch.  The only thing going for this place is bright lights and long hours.  You will do better going into virtually any corner pizza/steak place with a 1970s pepsi sign hanging over the door.",5,"kUz4S5fNAL7rRe0fWxm2Sw"

Only problem is, I received about 30 different answers from 30 different people. I eventually came across someone who explained the cheesesteak culture to me perfectly. It became clear that there is not necessarily a number one spot to get a cheesesteak because you have the touristy/famous spots and you have the local spots and everything has a different opinion. Ultimately what we decided is that we would visit the corner where two historical cheesesteak establishments have battled it out for years. Geno's and Pat's are right across the street from one another and both famous for their steaks. I was told unless I get a cheesesteak with ""wiz & onions,"" it wasn't the real thing. After I placed my order I sat at one of the nearby picnic tables and began to chow down. Surprisingly, one of the best things about that sandwich was the bread. Perfect weight and just crunchy enough to trap the juices from the steak, yet soft enough to bite off with no issues. The wiz was top notch, and Geno's House-made hot sauce was incredible. Typically when I order cheese fries, they become soft and unappealing but these fries has enough crunch to avoid the soggy expectation I had. Probably the best cheese fries I've ever had.    LONG story short, go to Geno's, get wiz, and be happy.",0,"poWB7bxe45fa2mQ8mnn5Qg"

Geno's doesn't have as many options as Pat's, but what they lack in options, they more than make up for in flavor!  Geno's slices their meat, which is a new concept to me when it comes to cheesesteaks.  I thought I'd prefer the diced meat on the grill better since it intermingles with all the other fixins, but I was wrong.  Whatever Geno's does with their meat, they sure do it right!   The cheesesteak also had more gooey whiz and much, much more flava!  Geno's wins hands down when it comes to the staple Philly cheesesteak.    Oh and just on a side note: these two establishments take their rivalry seriously. I saw a Pat's patron attempting to load her cheesesteak up with some condiments at Geno's and was quickly heckled (in unison) by an army of Geno's employees.

My grandfather lived in Philly for a while and when he moved to California with his kids, he instilled a love for cheesesteaks in them and his grandchildren as well. However, I always love a chance to go to the famous Geno's or Pat's. Though I have no true loyalty having only been to each once, I really enjoyed Geno's a lot. Being a 'foreigner' to Philly, I did not quite know the right lingo to order, and though I'm sure all the employees were laughing at me, they helped me out and got my cheesesteak to me promptly.  It's a Philadelphia classic and I definitely recommend it to all.

So when I went to this place, I thought the place would be an easy place to find......NOOOOO!!!!!!! Instead, it's in a place that's like a back alley place with horrible parking and crowded areas.  But, when I went to Geno's, it was lighted up like a Las Vegas strip mall.  So, we went to buy some of the sandwiches and we both noticed that there was two windows, each side had different menus: one for the drinks and fries, and the other for the sandwiches.  IMO, I never seen this and literally, I don't like the fact that I have to order from two different windows just to get the drinks. So, noooo!!!.  Anyways, my friend and I order their TWO different types of sandwiches (Pat's by the way have over 20 items on their menu) with the typical three different types of cheese: cheez whiz, provolone, and american. So what to choose!?!?!?!?!?!? I chose the cheesesteak w/ onions and cheez whiz.  My friend orders the same with provolone and cheez whiz and without onions....but the sandwich didn't come with the cheez whiz and it had onions in it (BOOOOOO!!!!).   We didn't want to go back to the counter since the guy making the sandwich and the woman on the cash register looked like they'd want to take a .... well, you know what I mean.  So, we both bring the sandwiches to a table and eat the food.  When I took a bite of that sandwich, I wanted more.  That's why I gave it 2 stars just to be reasonable.  But, the bread was too thick with what little meat they put in it.  So, in my experience, go to Geno's for their overpriced sandwiches and their sandwiches in which you'll taste more of the cheese and the sandwich than the meat that's in it.  I like the sandwich for what it is....but that's all they have to impress.",0,"sD5RtH5hVh7vqzr89VloWA"

We asked him what the score was for the Eagles game (the game was playing on a TV right behind him), and he said ""I see cheesesteaks, I don't tell people what the scores are."" 5 minutes later, a Caucasian guy asked him the same questions, and he told him what the score was.

At the top of my list was Gino's and Pat's. But really Gino's thanks to Boyz To Men singin' and dancin' in front of Gino's in one of their videos and all the hype around their cheesesteaks. So we got to Philly at about 10:45am and get a taxi straight to Gino's. There were people eating outside but...no line! I'd expected to see a line wrapped around the block. When I told the nice lady workin' the Gino's window as much, she reminded me that it was early in the am that it usually gets busy around 11. Sure enough as I was sitting there eatin' my cheesesteak, more folks started arriving. Whoa, lemme back up a bit... So after the lady broke it down for me why there was no line, I gave her my order: one ""whiz wit"" (cheese whiz and onions) and one ""prov wit"" (provolone and onions). I did a little research before going. Had I not, I woulda gone up there askin' for ""a cheesesteak."" So, we're chattin' while my sammiches are being made and she gets the bag ready and say, ""I'm gonna put a souvenir in the bag for ya. Don't forget it's in there."" Sweet woman. She gave me two Gino's pens. Aside from it being a nice gesture, it's great advertising, lol.   So what did it taste like!? Fresh!! I'm a carboholic. I love bread. If the bread on a sammich is fresh, that can take a sammich up to a Spinal Tap 11! The bread was so soft and warm and fresh, the meat was fresh and flavorful, the onions, yeah, they were good too. It's a messy sammich but I ain't mad at that! The messy sammiches are the best ones! Just sloppy and delicious and messy!   Overall, my Gino's experience was great! Thank you, Gino's for kickin' off my Philly Food Tour with a bang! Thanks for the souvenirs, too. *MWAH*",2,"h6dndPALlpFXpknjtkyb8w"

I'm all mad and wanting to rant! So here it goes (*ahem*)  My sister recently moved to Philadelphia from Atlanta, and so I'm here for a weekend getaway. She being new and me being hungry almost always, she suggests we participate in the little tourist trap that consists of eating a lot of cheese steak from places that are kind of old and then deciding which one is the best, a.k.a: the Pat's versus Geno's showdown.   My Verdict: Neither of them are really all that, but of the two it's definitely Pat's. Plain and simple, their cheese steak is just much, much better. Geno's bread is hard, they don't put enough cheese, the steak itself is mediocre. Dude, it's really just not good. I mean, you could very easily make something more delicious at home and not get in a panic that you're going to order it wrong and be sent to the back of the line. Cause they do that there, apparently. And you know what that's just rude!  But hear me out cause that's not why I'm all mad and stuff. Because it's after the 30 minute wait in the cold -- yet before the first bite of plllllppp cheesesteak -- that the fury begins. Because in that window of time, ladies and gentlemen, you're surrounded by shamelessly RACIST propaganda all over the walls of the actual establishment. Have you ever seen a person or a place actually boast about being a complete racist? It's strange, it's unsettling, and if I didn't have a healthy appetite almost always I would probably say unappetizing. A bunch of bigots, I say! Bloody bigots!  So what I suggest is to, honestly, forget the tourist trap all together. Ask a local where the REAL cheese steak is, because I'm telling you this place ain't it by a long shot.  But if you just gotta go for the experience nonetheless, in the very least go to Pat's first when you're actually hungry for semi-decent food. I say order a ""wit whiz"" and grab a couple hot peppers to spice up the experience. Ketchup on the side is also nice. Ask for no ice if you order a soda, cause they gip you with a cup full of ice (both places do).   But all together, don't support a mediocre establishment like Geno's. Because let's face it they're only in business because of some misguided food rivalry that got started who-knows-how. And cause it's obvious that not only do they have no pride in food quality, they have little respect for their patrons (dude, those guys are pushy) or for an entire race of people with their totally ludicrous displays of asinine, ignorant, flat-out racist propaganda. Man! This place totally ruined my feel-good vibe for, like, a solid hour! That lasts longer than the heartburn!  Geno's, I'm sorry to tell you, but you kinda suck big time in  the categories of deliciousness and, apparently, moral fiber. I award you no points.",9,"BfG1LW9JFEm5Zs4TXL8s2Q"

Last time we were here we visited Pat's (""The King of Cheesesteak"").  What's the difference? I'll let you know in a moment.  This area is a bit off the beaten path in a completely residential neighborhood. Street parking only. They are right across the street from a little league ball field and basketball court. Location is ADA compliant because there is no indoor seating, nor any restrooms, although there are a token number of tables with seats outdoors. Let me say be prepared for a totally casual experience and to eat drippingly sloppy but mouth watering cheesesteaks - so make sure you grab a bunch of napkins (and if you remember, bring some wet naps!).  Both Geno's and Pat's operate in the same manner - step up to the window to order cheesesteaks ONLY! Fries and drinks are at another window.  It is always busy at both locations and I don't think the workers get more than a two-minute window when no one is ordering. The lines may be long from time to time but they have cooking the stuff down to a science that the wait is usually no more than a few minutes.  All seating is outdoors and at the condiment counter on curbside are napkins and condiments.  Sandwiches at both places are a good size.  Pricing is on menu I've added in photo. Both Geno's and Pat's are exactly same size and price, but Pat's (last time we were there) only offers the cheesesteaks with Cheez Whiz, Genos offers three choices: Cheez Whiz, White American, and Provolone. I have to tell you when I first heard Cheez Whiz I said ""what?"". It works.. must be the secret sauce we're not supposed to know about. You can add peppers for $2 extra (onions are included in price).  Where prices differ in both locations?  1A. Geno's soda is $3   B. Pat's soda is $3.50 (or $3.75 - sorry don't remember what I saw on the sign today)   2A. Genos cheese fries are $5   B. Pat's cheese fries is $6 (?)  Geno's builds the tax into the cost so the numbers come out to the nearest quarter. No more pennies or bizzare change amounts to calculate, yeah!  Tastes?  Geno's tastes a bit more-lean so possibly healthier (ha, healthy cheesesteak? well at least healthy than a fatty one). Pat's cheesesteaks from what I can remember were a bit more tasty, but more greasy, and my guess is not as lead as Geno's.  Waits? Geno's moves faster than Pat's.  Parking? Anywhere on the street where you can find it. If you go during week be careful of the tricky parking restrictions. The streets are narrow and in some cases parking on one side or in another scenario you will have cars honking you as you stop to back into a parking spot. You can usually find a spot within a block or two because turnover is real fast. I believe most people come, grab and go.  There is also an indoor cheesesteak among this cheeselight district - South Philly Cheesesteak - it's like a pub with cheesesteak, alcohol, and indoor seating - but noisy.  Dessert? Not at Geno's nor Pat's, but right next to Geno's is the Cannoli King where you can get a freshly stuffed cannoli for $7 (pistachio, hazelnut. dark chocolate or milk chocolate covered cannolis) or Gelato.  These are great Philly cheesesteaks which the ratings don't show for because of their casual no indoor seating, type of food, and just cursory window service. Great to have once in a while and worth a try but don't get into the habit if you want to lead a long life.  Bon Appetite!",5,"0OO3xIvQxjl_dWf-mOBzBg"

We were freezing but so hungry, and we were a little shocked at first to find that the only seating that there was was the benches outside. Mind you, it was like 20 degrees and there were 2 women sitting on the bench eating like it was no big deal - I thought that was awesome.  The guy at the second (fry) window was so helpful. I asked what we were supposed to do and he told me just how to order what I wanted so I didn't look like an idiot. He also directed us over to the bar across the street (The Garage) so that we could sit inside and eat our food.  Each of our sandwiches were amazing. Perfect little strips of steak, cheese wiz (which I thought I was going to hate, but there's seriously no other way that you should order this sandwich), and onions. Bread was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy right away - gotta eat it fast!  I will likely try the rival place across the street (Pat's?) before I return, just for good measure.

Pat's: Cut up pieces of meat with, but there is only a small amount of cheese whiz on top making the rest of the sandwich dry. However, the onions were pretty good for Pat's.

Both places are located across from one another in South Philly at the crossroads of South 9th Street and East Passyunk Avenue.  In the middle of the ""x"" on one side is Pat's and across the street in the middle of the ""x"" is Geno's. It is a strange configuration, however it has been working for this neighborhood since the 60's and as the saying goes ""if it ain't broke, then don't fix it.""  From Pat's we ordered  a mushroom steak wiz wit. (wiz=Cheese Whiz, wit=with onions) .  From Geno's we ordered a steak provolone wit.  We sat down at a table halved the subs and began our comparison.  TASTE  In this food challenge Pat's beat Geno's hands down. The bread from Pat's was soft and warm and the meat was sliced thin, seasoned, juicy and tender. We did not think we would be fans of canned/jar cheese (Cheese Whiz) on a sandwich, however it worked and it was a pleasure to eat. On the other hand the bread from Geno's was a little tough and chewy. Their meat was sliced thicker than Pat's and did not seem to have any flavor even though we had onions and cheese added to our cheesesteaks.  CUSTOMER SERVICE  I'm big on customer service and this is where Geno's earns it's stars. When it comes down to customer service Geno's won hands down. Their staff was very friendly and seemed to care as well as be delighted that we chose their establishment over the competition. On the other hand, the staff at Pat's was loud and kept screaming next the whole time. They rudely took our order, along with our money and then slid our order through the window and yelled next. This behavior was quite entertaining and was just like I had viewed on PBS specials and other food related shows that featured Geno's and Pat's.  AESTHESTICS  Geno's was more aesthetically pleasing.Their colors and neon signage was bold and inviting. Reminiscent of food vendors at a carnival.  On the other hand Pat's was in a plain white building with vintage (minimal) signage. There was nothing spectacular about the way Pat's looked.  We were also impressed that Geno's owned the building across the street from their cheesesteak location that seemed to be dedicated to Geno memorabilia as well as had a memorial in front of their establishment that was dedicated to the fallen Philadelphia firefighters and police officers (more stars and kudos).",4,"3wo_XFYuG_WhbQjSoyq_3A"

The cheese was evenly layered, thickening the sandwich and providing good taste. The roll looked better at first glance, but wasn't as firm as I prefer.   Geno's has essentially commercialized the cheesesteak with their fluorescent neon signs and flashy storefront, but it's certainly not indicative of its quality. It's a fine steak - adequate and serviceable, but doesn't come close to the smaller spots around Philly.   If you're trying to have some fun and looking to compare steaks, Geno's and Pat's is the touristy site to hit up.

Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect.  #2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier.  #3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent.  #4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice.   #5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip.

It's only natural (and obligatory for that matter) that I try THE PHILLY CHEESESTEAK.  Now, I love a good drama so learning about the battle of bests between Geno's & Pat's made it even more exciting to try this local staple.  Geno's was founded by one of Philly's own, Joey Vento in 1966. The man had two boxes of steaks, a few hot dogs, and $6 in his pocket when he turned on the grills at 9th and Passyunk. Neighboring joints predicted he'd last six months, tops. Fun fact, Joey named his son Geno and Geno is currently running the place. Geno's claims to use only the best, thinly sliced rib-eye steak. I was actually surpirsed that it so it grilled up so nice and juicy and that is was not greasy! They use fresh onions but I opted to have mine without (I'm sure they turned their nose up at that one! I completely appreciated that the bread was so fresh, right out of the oven! I was worried about the whole ""cheese whiz"" option. But I kept reading about how I had to make sure I added the homemade cheese on it. FINE! Wow, I was totally surprised! They shouldn't market it as the same caliber as cheese in a can though, totally different experience. It was melted and had great consistency and combined with the fresh steak it was pretty awesome! Not ready for the whiz? You can still get cheese and opt for provolone or american. It's a bit pricey - flat $10 for the sandwich. You could opt for fries for an extra $4 or cheese fries for an extra $5. I just went for the cheese steak to save room in my stomach to try the competition after.  Speaking of the competition, I think Geno's wins. Better food, friendlier service and even though both locations are pick up windows (you don't go inside, you eat out front) Geno's seemed a lot cleaner.",3,"azEfTiM31JcoCaQca0R2Cw"

And since they are literally across the street from each other, I encourage you to do what we've always done and try them both for that real Philly experience. Besides, dinging either one of these places for taste would be like giving the Liberty Bell a bad rating because it has a crack in it and doesn't ring pure anymore. These places are historic institutions and the heart of some of Philly's heritage.  With that said, I've been coming here since the 80's and for my money right now have a slight leaning towards Geno's. Here's my breakdown:  Pat's: * dryer bread and meat * crunchy onions * cheaper wiz * harsher service  Geno's: * juicy meat * carmelized onions * steamed roll * gooey cheese * friendlier staff  While they are both institutions, I prefer to have that greasy, juicy flavor dripping off my cheesteak.   A couple final recommendations before stepping up to the window: read the instructions and learn the lingo. It's rather simple and broken down into but three steps. And bring cash, they don't take plastic. This will definitely make your experience a more memorable one.

Earlier today, we visited The Museum of American Revolution and was wondering how far it was from the museum. I googled it and it was a 15 minute drive. We arrived and I noticed that there was NO parking and we ended circling around the neighborhood  and managed to park near a baseball field not too far. I was deciding on who to go first to and I saw that Geno's had a very long line, but it was going quickly. We ordered a philly cheese steak no onions with white American cheese, our cost $10. We wanted to taste some fries and we were pointed to walk down a little further. I ordered a cup of fries and the cost was $4. Geno's only accepts CASH no type of credit at all and the price also includes the tax. I asked the attendant that the items were both to go and they were placed in bags.  As I was walking, I noticed that Geno's had a gift shop. I being the nosy person that I am, went inside to see what they offered. I ended up purchasing a shot glass ($6) and refrigerator magnet ($5), now they accept credits cards on purchases of $10 or more. When we arrived home we did the taste test. I did three equal cuts of all three sandwiches purchased: Campo's, Pat's and Geno's.   I bit into Geno's philly cheesesteak, bread tasted very fresh (soft chewy texture) steak was a little on the bland side, and personally there wasn't enough cheese on the steak. I found it somewhat dry, the next up were the fries. Fries were still warm but had that crunch texture and it really did not need no ketchup. Crazy as it sound I prefer Geno's fries over Pat's. Now this is one of those tourist's attractions that people visit. It all depends on your taste buds, and what you like. I came here to say that I had a philly cheese steak from Philly.

It was freezing cold that evening but you can't make that trip and not have a PCS.    We had had a great 12 inch Philly Cheesesteak.  Each sandwhich was priced at about $9.75.  It was prepared with a creamy spread of cheese and fresh cooked hot steak with a grilled onions on top.  DELICIOUS!!    Of course when I posted pics on my social media pages, there were comments about the competitors such as Pat's which was just across the street.

The sandwich is nice and greasy, while the cheese and ""juices"" drip from your sandwich. Flavor wise, the large whole slices of rib-eye don't have much flavor on their own but the cheese whiz brings the saltiness and richness. As for the bread, there's a slight chew to it.  We also ordered x3 drinks and an order of fries for $13. Long story short, the fries were good but I'm not sure what the big deal is all about.  SERVICE:  I had a great experience--from ordering to licking the cheese whiz from my finger tips after devouring my sandwich. Contrary to many of the negative reviews, the staff here were friendly and smiling. Both Geno's and Pat's thrive on getting food out quickly; thus, if you're holding up the line, I can understand why you get an attitude. Know what you want before getting in line.  Overall, Geno's serves up good cheesesteaks. It has it's differences with Pat's, so it's up to you to decide which one fits your tastes better; read my review for Pat's for the differences. The place is touristy, but that's to be expected. As a side note, they have a hanging glass case with all kinds of neat patches (police, medical, fire) from around the country and world on display.",7,"e1dYw-1Km6IAwXlOLIMAeg"

It is buttery, delicious bread with melted cheese (I get the whiz wit - cheese whiz and grilled onions) and shaved meat on it. If you don't want it greasy, you have issues.   I took off a star because the quality of their meat isn't as good as it could be, for instance, as good as Pat's.

The combination of the grease, big pieces of steak and the soft roll just cant be beat. Nothing, and I mean nothing beats a Geno's after drinking all night. I always opt for the American cheese too, no whiz. The American gives it that extra flavor that whiz just cant deliver.  You need to laugh off the people that say Pats and Geno's are for ""tourists"". Pats and Geno's are the gold standard in the city. Everyone wants to make it sound like THEY have the go to spot just so they feel better about themselves. Comparing Pats/Geno's to places like Tony Luke's and Jim's is like comparing Coke and Pepsi. Yeah, both taste good but we all know Coke is the pioneer and undisputed champ that started it all - as are Geno's and Pats.   Location; If you think Geno's is in the ""ghetto"", then you've never ACTUALLY been to a REAL ghetto. Hit me up sometime, we'll go for a ride.  I'll miss Joey Vento. Its so rare to see and meet people that speak their mind these days given everyone in the world is SO sensitive about EVERY thing.

It still wasn't as good as most people rant and rave about.  I can honestly get a better cheesesteak in NYC.  So out of Pat's and Geno's, Geno's wins.

The onions and mushrooms fell flat. The cheese fries were ok.  There are two ordering windows: one for fries, one for cheesesteaks. Cash only!

After one bite of my cheesesteak, I was just plain confused on why this place is well known. The steak was very meh and a little tough, the bread was hard, there wasn't enough cheese on the steak, and the fries were nothing special. The most obnoxious thing about this restaurant is that you can't even get a plain cup of tap water for your meal unless you want to pay $3 for a fountain soda and have them fill the cup up with tap water instead. I would think a cup of tap water wouldn't be that costly for a restaurant where customers have bought into their gimmick to the point where the restaurant has its own souvenir shop. The restaurant also seems to be too cheap to provide mini cups to dispense ketchup and other condiments. As in, you have to go through the hassle of unwrapping your cheesesteak to add condiments before you find seating/leave and that you have to put your ketchup directly on your fries.  Lastly, the parking situation around the restaurant really isn't the greatest  since it's in a residential area. The seating in the restaurant is extremely limited and there aren't any nice areas or parks close by to take your food if you can't find a seat. Definitely not worth the trek to South Philly!",2,"et7Ndr07Kz-4wX8bbmQjWg"

My wife and I had to try both Pat's and Geno's to compare for ourselves which is the best.  I reviewed Pat's also.  You can read that review as well.  We ordered one ""wit whiz and wit"" from each place.  Honestly, I don't know why this place continues to exist except for the hype TV gives it.  There is nothing about this place that would make me want to come back.  Even if they gave me a lifetime free pass for food I would go elsewhere......PASS.  So the truth about the feud....Pat's is much better than Geno's.  The meat was flavorless....no spices.......the hoagie roll was cold......the Whiz was one small squirt and only on one end of the sandwich.  The onions were not even cooked through.  Talk about hype.......Pat's blows Geno's out of the swimming pool.  Truth be told this would be the last place in Philly I would come for a decent sandwich.  We have a local chain called: Big John's Steak and Onion that makes a better sandwich that either of these two.    As for getting there.....these two establishments are in a bad part of town.  Parking is terrible.  We parked about a block away, right in front of a storefront where they were raising chickens.  The stench was overwhelming.  Garbage was everywhere.  These Philadephians need to learn to throw their garbage away like the rest of the world.  The entire city needs a bath.  We had to work our way around all types of litter and garbage.  Nice way to eat a meal.  The smell of chicken crap and rotting garbage just enhances the meal so much (sarcasm Sheldon).  My advice, go to Reading Terminal Market if you want to experience a Philly Cheese Steak.  At least you have a seat and dessert is but a few steps away, and when I say dessert I don't mean some type of crunchy cookie but excellent desserts.

After a scary drive through snow from Cooperstown, NY to Philadelphia, my buddy and I were excited to start our third leg of our East Coast Americana Tour visiting the historical sites of Philadelphia.  One of the things that we agreed we had to eat on our East Coast trip was a Philly cheesesteak in Philadelphia.  In 2017, my daughter and I visited Philadelphia for a volleyball tournament and we ate a Philly cheesesteak at Pat's King of Steaks, which is just down the road from Geno's and is its main competitor to the lofty claim of being the best cheesesteak in Philly.  In my opinion, Geno's is the winner of the cheesesteak competition between Geno's and Pat's.  During both my trips to Geno's and Pat's albeit three years apart, I visited both restaurants at night.  Both times I was nervous driving through the residential area to get to these restaurants because the streets are narrow and I've run into sketchy people.  At Geno's on this trip, a gentleman asked if we had money and loitered around as we ordered our food.  I say this to make sure people are aware of their surroundings especially at night and maybe you visit Geno's during the day.  Parking is difficult to find for Geno's as you'll have to find parking in the adjacent residential area.  As we walked to Geno's after finding parking, we were greeted by the overt neon lights advertising Geno's and serving as a beacon for Philly cheesesteak lovers to find their location.  Geno's is Cash Only, so make sure you go to the ATM or bank before you visit the restaurant.  The restaurant is order the Philly cheesesteak at one window of the restaurant and the sides/drinks at another window.  There are metal picnic benches where you can eat your food, but due to the sketchy dude and how cold it was, we decided to engulf our cheesesteak sandwich in our car.  Since we had eaten dinner, this trip to Geno's was going to be a late night snack for my buddy and I, but after eating this delicious and impeccable sandwich, we both admitted that we should not have split one sandwich and instead ordered a sandwich for each of us.  When ordering the Philly cheesesteak, there is a traditional way to order the sandwich.  The traditional way is to order the cheesesteak wit cheese whiz, which is the cheese sauce that a lot of us remember growing up as kids, and you can add grilled onions.  That's what I ordered with my daughter three years ago.  My buddy isn't a cheese whiz fan, so we decided to order our cheesesteak with provolone and grilled onions.  I highly recommend that you do the same unless you want to compare the traditional versus the way we ordered it.  The Philly cheesesteak at Geno's was heavenly scrumptious.  The meat was cooked perfectly tender, the melted provolone and the grilled onions completely enhanced the sandwich, and the bread was soft and was the perfect vessel for all of the ingredients.  We savored each bite and just couldn't stop talking about how tasty that sandwich was.  I ordered the cheese fries to go along with our sandwich and I recommend you do the same.  The fries were crunchy, seasoned right, and the melted cheese sauce was finger licking delectable.  When you visit Philadelphia, you'll have the opportunity to compare Geno's or Pat's to determine whose restaurant has the best Philly cheesesteak since they are within close proximity of each other.  I believe the winner is Geno's based on my most recent visit, but if I ever get back to Philadelphia, I want to compare apples to apples by trying the same type of sandwich at Pat's.  I'm a Philly cheesesteak fan and Geno's made me more of a fan after eating one of their sandwiches.",3,"TdDxMS27vu0fXXxIvz16bQ"

I got mine with cheese wiz, and my friend got hers with provolone.

For a long time I've been curious about Pat's and Geno's, probably thanks to features on TV.  I finally made it to Philly and tried them both.  Going to Geno's was exciting and I appreciated the friendly staff and prompt service.  It was also nice that being the dead of winter there was not a line.  But the downside to going in the dead of winter was having to eat a hot cheesesteak on a cold picnic bench in the middle of a cramped and dirty part of Philly.   I think the famous rivalry between Geno's and Pat's is fun and in the end it probably helps both businesses get more customers.  I personally liked Pat's sandwich better than Geno's because Pat's bread is soft while Geno's bread is chewy.  Another differentiator is that Pat's steak is chopped up while Geno's is more intact slices.  I imagine some people prefer Geno's slices over Pat's clumps of sliced and cut steak.   I would have enjoyed my experience better if I could have eaten the $10 cheesesteak in a more temperate location with access to a bathroom.  This is also the same deal at Pat's.  Given that, on my next trip to Philly I would look for a delicious cheesesteak place with more leisurely and comfortable seating.

We split a regular cheese steak (with real cheese) and grilled onions, added relish and ketchup. Though the meat was flavorful, the cheese steak was very dry. The bread did not get too soggy and was not chewy, which was good.

Perhaps they are right, but for my first time excursion in Philadelphia, I had to try the two shops I heard most about over the past few years.  As far as service goes both seem to be equally as fast.  Service of sandwiches are usually under 10 - 15 seconds from the time you order.  Despite what they my say on television, I don't believe you have to order ""in a special manner, cheese WIT or cheese WIT-OUT,"" at Pat's.  Its probably more of a gimmick then anything.  As long as you don't stutter, you should be alright.  Onto the sandwiches.  Pat's had a bit more meat in their sandwich but Geno's was more tender and I found that the bread that Geno's had used tasted better, it had a bit of sweetness as well as a nice bit of moisture in comparison to that of Pat's.  In the end I ended up bringing only one Pat's Cheesesteak home, while also bringing home 3 Geno's Cheesesteaks.  Nothing wrong with Pat's Cheesesteaks, but nothing special either.

I rarely hit Pat's either, but occasionally post-bar, I'll need food and have no other options.  But my cousin was in from out of town, and wanted to try the famous one, so I found myself at Geno's, mostly because the line was shorter.  I had honestly forgotten just how stingy Geno's gets with the meat.  I think my sandwich had 2 slices of steak on it.  I also usually get whiz at the tourist traps, but decided against it when I saw the pile of pre-whizzed rolls behind the glass.  Sorry, the point of whiz is that the tourist traps are too lazy to melt the provolone or american into the meat while it's on the grill, so its the only hot, melted cheese you can get.  If it has time to cool down on the roll, it loses its only advantage and reveals just how disgusting it really is..  So instead I got provolone, and the accompanying river of grease when I picked picked it up.  At least the roll was decent.  I skipped the fascist fries, and failed to order in english (""provo wit"" would not please Mr. Webster).  I was surprised to find they don't even have sweet peppers available at the grill.  Basically, unless you have an out of town guest who wants to try the famous places, skip it for a better joint.",5,"dioXbYFdMCyE7zCK90eM3Q"

That being said, it was my dream to stand beside the Rocky statue and to run up the infamous steps that my hero has run up so many times. I did exactly that last Tuesday as my wife Laura, my brother Danny and I took a trip to the city of brotherly love. While there, we had to eat an authentic Philly cheesesteak because can you even say you visited Philly if you don't? My brother Danny had visited Philly once in the 80's and had gone to Geno's before and told us how delicious it was. Boy, was that an understatement. We all got the ""whiz wit"" cheesesteak, which for those not familiar with the lingo is a cheesesteak with cheese whiz and onions. As soon as I took my first bite, I wished that I had gotten two of them. The bread was what every sandwich roll should be, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and so delicious. And inside, the tender meat sans of any grizzle or fat just melted in my mouth. The salty and creamy cheese whiz, while not visible to the human eye because it had kind of soaked into the meat, was there in a big way. And I usually don't order onions on anything, I actually surprised Laura and Danny by doing so. But, I wanted to eat the most authentic Philly Cheesesteak that I could and even as someone who says ""no onions"" on the regular, I would not have omitted them in this case as they just helped tie together one of the best things I have eaten in my entire life. I have absolutely no complaints about Geno's, except for the fact that it is too far away from my hometown of Oswego NY lol. Word of warning though, Geno's is a CASH ONLY business. So either bring cash with you, or hit up the ATM across the street at the bar like we did. Either way, you will not regret eating at Geno's.

Now to the food, I ordered a cheesesteak wit wiz and fries. The cheesesteak meat didnt taste like it had any seasoning and I could've used a bit more wiz to balance out the meat to cheese ratio.

The more research we did, we were inspired to do a taste test. We were told Pat's and Geno's. I love the cheesiness and peppers of Pat's. My wife didn't like the gristle of the steak and she says it can be toothsome. I feel it adds to the flavor. Geno's for me, I felt the meat was dry and not enough cheese. My wife loved it to include the cut of steak; however, she agreed it needed to be seasoned. We tried the hot sauce and it was phenomenal bringing it home to Texas.

The line moved quickly because everyone there knew exactly what they wanted.   This was my first time there so I'm not sure what type of setup they had before. But for these COVID times - there is one window where you can order the cheesesteaks and another window where you can order your drinks and fries. There are seats all around the block. People here are polite and do not hold seats, they only sit down when they already have their food in their hands. Also, they were good at finishing up quickly, so we were able to find a seat immediately when we got our food.   I ordered the ""whiz wit"" - with the advice of my friend who didn't want me to embarrass myself, I googled how to order like a local. Apparently, there is cheesesteak lingo for quick ordering. I still don't understand why ""wit"" means ""with onions"" but who cares, I got my order exactly the way I wanted. My cheesesteak (with cheez wiz and onions) was ready within 30 secs. After I ordered, I stood around the window and the lady called me when it was ready. The steak was perfectly sliced and seasoned. The cheese melted in my mouth and blended so well with the onions. The onions were also cooked well, it had the perfect crunch and it wasn't soggy at all. My second Philly cheesesteak from Philly ever, and it did not disappoint. My goal is to keep coming back to Philly to try all the famous spots so I can pick the best one.",8,"ksBWrqnjT6fL6nulF_GYZQ"

Although I live on the west coast now, I dearly miss all that is sacred to my past life; italian hoagies, questionable street corner soft-pretzels, boardwalk slices, NJ grease trucks and... the daddy of it all, PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS!   It is not a culinary art to this... chopped beef, American, Provolone or Wiz, optional FO, peppers, mushrooms, etc. all sandwiched into that unmistakeable South Philly roll.  Fast forward to the other day... My wife and I are packed and ready to get out to the east coast for our annual visit. We were excited to see family and old friends, but what we jokingly talk about and look forward to all year is catching up with our favorite foods. We vowed to have a cheesesteak in our hands within a short time of landing at PHL!   We pick up the car and jet up  to Passyunk & 9th ASAP.  She had never been any further down in the past than Jim's on South so we decide to get one of each and let her decide what she likes. We park, mosey up to Pat's, order an American, get a good-old grumpy smile, ""Thanku!"" and move on.   On to Geno's; oohs and ahhs for all the neon, it used to never get old to see. Joey was always proud of his palace! We step up, pay for a Wiz Cheesesteak with FO and then step to the side to the condo-counter.   Yeah, now here it comes... Needing a quick squirt of ketchup I get in line with one other patron with no one else behind me. So while standing there, mind you as a paying customer of both establishments, the older woman at the second window leans out and screeches ""Oh no, don't use that ketchup!""  Our little line freezes like she was trying to tell us the ketchup was bad, empty, etc. NO, it was not the case, she proceeds in saying towards the man in front of me ""Oh no, not you sir, you're fine, get what you need."" Then pointing her finger out the window and waving her hands around ""You, I mean you, get outta' here with that crap!""  In front of my wife;  a first and last time customer, in front of dozens of patrons; adults and children, in front of police officers on the corner, now taking interest in me like I was causing this...   (Huh?)   She says again ""I said get outta here with that crap, you don't use our counter, get back across the street."" In my disbelief I ask her if she was joking and proceeded to explain I just bought a Geno's steak 30 seconds prior. Nothing, same stonewall, same yelling. I ask for a manager to come out, an older gentleman sticks his head out the window and yells ""Are you friggin' deaf, leave!""  Now the grill boys and back of house staff crowds to the windows and doorways with the same malice. I admit it; I then yelled back, I cursed, I was furious, I was insulted and I was humiliated in front of my wife and strangers. The curses follow me as I get off the curb and walk away back to Pat's past the gauntlet of keenly interested boys-in-blue.  I do not care what your schtick or marketing gimmick is... I do not care that times are tough and budgets are tight... I do not care that you might have been having a tough year...  No matter what ones company does it all boils down to customer service. It does not matter if they are shrouded in filthy rags buying a $2 whiskey shooter or in Oscar de la Renta buying their third Mercedes; each and every customer deserves every bit of dignity and respect as the next. No exceptions, even if you have to lie through your teeth while holding your nose because of their smell... All are treated with respect.  This establishment did not show that they knew and/or cared to exhibit this very basic business practice. If so, I would have completely understood that ""No Outside Food or Drink"" meant more than just someone sitting at their tables eating a ham sandwich. We did not intend to even sit at their tables. I had done the same action for decades before without this consequence. She could have politely, privately and/or quietly asked me to move on, it actually means their condiments also.    In retrospect now that we reflect on the actual consumption of each steak safely back at Pat's tables, my wife honestly remarked that the Geno's Steak bread was so-so and the ""fried"" onions she ordered with it were closer to the side of raw than the latter. My Pat's American with FO was enjoyable despite the incident, I tore thru it and then a second reorder in five minutes. The roll was soft, the onions and beef seemed fine; but I can't honestly give my latest review of a Pat's steak with certainty,  I just wanted to get out of the area as quick as possible; I was humiliated and my wife was deeply embarrassed.  All due respect to the late Mr. Bento, I apologize if I slighted your house. But I am deeply disappointed that a company believes they can treat anyone in this manner for any reason. All this over 9/10ths of a cent worth of ketchup...",9,"qrEg5EFDJpVMbzpJ2aN4xQ"

Before I went, I completed my training on ""how to order a cheese steak"". I was all ready to go ""Whiz wit!"", which for those cheese steak virgins means ""cheese steak with cheese whiz and onion"". By the time I walked up to the window, I decided to test the cheese steak nazi by ordering in a non-compliant way. I was surprised that I didn't get yelled at. It may have something to do with me being the only person on the line. I did get rudely sent to the next window for my root beer though.  As soon as I got the cheese steak, I opened it up and munched it down in 5 minutes. It was a good sandwich. I must say that it was better than any cheese I have ever had in the mall. However, it wasn't mind blowing by any stretch. I probably wouldn't take the time to visit again unless I happen to walk by the store. The cost was $30 in taxi fare to get there, $30 in taxi fare to get back to where I was and 10 bucks for the food.  Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.5  Service 0.1: The service was fine.

For one, there are multiple pictures posted of the founder next to signs saying things such as ""It's America - speak English when you order"" or ""I'm mad as hell; I want my country back."" This turned me off from the place immediately, but I still decided to try their cheesesteak since it is well-known. Because of the popularity of the restaurant, the service is brusque and borders on unfriendly. Now, moving on to the actual food: I noticed two major problems that, together, create a sub-par cheesesteak. First, since they serve so many people, the steak is not cooked to order. You get your food only a few seconds after ordering it. Although this may allow them to serve more customers more quickly, it makes for a cheesesteak that is not nearly hot and fresh enough. Further, the steak is chopped into unusually large pieces. I suppose this must just be how they do it at Geno's, but this customer certainly felt as though it decreased the quality of their product substantially. Had I got this from any old restaurant, I would have just shrugged, made a note that that restaurant doesn't have very good cheesesteaks, and moved on. However, Geno's is widely popular and claims to be the best. I can only understand its popularity by guessing that most of its customers are tourists who don't know any better, and I find its claims to greatness to be, frankly, insulting to one of my favorite foods.",1,"tWZfFI_h_hRHvIBhKImECA"

This restaurant has all the hype because it has been here forever, but they lack to deliver quality food. The steak was bland and the fries had an awful after taste. So I was truly disappointed!!!! Maybe since they have been here for so long they don't put as much effort into the taste.  There are only 2 types of sandwiches: one with provolone cheese and the other has American cheese (which is basically Cheese Wiz) and both have onions. I have never once eaten a philly sub that required me to add ketchup because of it being so dry. The provolone cheese sub was so dry!!!! Who would ever think about putting cheese wiz on a philly sub??? The only reason why this tasted better to me was because it wasn't dry. I could care less for neither one of them.   Does anyone ever come out to clean those tables? They all were filthy. On top of the wind blowing all of our napkins on the ground, we had to sit at a dirty table.

So will you please stop being an ass clown Joey Vento?  4) Fact of the matter is that unless we're drunk enough to the point that we end up regretting our food choices the next morning, most real Philadelphians don't bother with Geno's or Pat's. Go to Tony Lukes, Steaks On South, John's Roast Pork, hell ANY other sandwich shop here that serves a cheesesteak, and you're bound to find something a lot better.

One selling point I'll give them is that the cheese wiz had a unique flavor with a little bit of spice to it.

So in conclusion, worth stopping based on the notoriety, but if you're looking for a 'full flavor no additions required' experience Philly cheesesteak stick to Jim's!",1,"NIx2ZWZ26WIG0JbtOeeqGA"

I was with my family and unfortunately it was probably the worst experience I've ever had.  At first, it was my fault, I thought this place accepted credit cards and when I placed my 3 cheese steak order, I was advised it was CASH ONLY!  The older lady running the register was rude and very unpleasant to deal with.  When I told her if she could tell me the closest ATM, she said it was across the street and immediately cancelled my order with the cooker.  She told him she didn't know if I had the money.  Embarrassed me and my family and its not professional to treat customers that way. So, I go across the street to the ATM and get the money.  I come back again to place my order a second time and after placing my order, I was given my three cheese steaks within a few minutes.  The wait time was reasonable.  The cheese steaks however, didn't have any cheese.  It had plenty of meat and good quality meat, but no cheese.  The meat, despite that it was good quality, was bland.  It didn't have any good taste or seasoning of any kind.  It was, however, loaded with onions.  Unfortunately, the cheese steaks tasted and appeared dried.  There's no in-door place to sit down and eat your food, so you have to sit outside in the cold and hope you don't get shot while you eat your food with your family.

Right down the street from me there's a small, privately owned breakfast shop run by the son of some Hakka immigrants from China.  Besides stuff like egg-pancakes and soy milk, this little shop is most famous  for their version of a common breakfast item known as a  fried-dough cruller wrapped in a griled pancake (shao bing you tiao;).  In fact, they are so well known for this specialty, people line up out the door for up to ten minutes in the morning to buy them.  So one day, I decided try this little place myself and see  what the hype was all about.   I got their around 9 in the morning and placed myself at the end of the long line that was now spilling into the street.   5 minutes later, I arrived at the front of the line and proceeded to bark my order to the shop owner, now furiously manning the griddle.     ""I'd like a fried dough cruller wrapped in a griddle pancake please!""  ""nin yiao she me?""  ""Ummm, fried dough umm, wrapped, um in panc....  ""she me?!?""  And with that highly eloquent retort,  he simply skipped over me and proceeded to take the order from the eager customer waiting in line right behind me, cash in hand.  Relegated to the end of the line and visibly embarrassed, I was nonetheless even more determined to do it right this time.  Upon reaching the same owner, who was still preoccupied with the same griddle, but who was now flipping fragrant sesame buns through the air, I managed to whimper a barely decipherable, ""yi ge shao bing you tiao"".     ""shao bin you tiao!;!"" the manager brusquely shouted to his daughter who was handling the money at the counter behind him.  It was then, while taking that first bite into that steaming, crunchy, pile of oily goodness, that I had an epiphany.   Even though the owner of that breakfast shop is still clearly some sort of bigoted racist for not taking my order in English, I really do get my food faster by ordering in Chinese.",4,"RBXVFcXR3IjP0CYgmkSmtg"

The staff was friendly, although all business.  I ordered a cheese steak wit whiz, onions and mushrooms (if you read my review of Pat's, same sandwich).  I really wanted it to be as good or better than Pat's because all of the cheese steak sandwiches I have had chop the steak like Pat's does and I liked the idea of whole slices, but I was disappointed on that note.  It had a unique flavor, so I can see why those who think Geno's is great would think Pat's and similar sandwiches are not.  I found it kind of bland, even the whiz was a bit thinner and less of it and less taste.  One thing that surprised me, though, since I was doing a head-to-head taste test, I ate 1/2 of each freshly made, put the other halves in a cooler to get back home.  After heating them up later for dinner, I actually would give Geno's a very slight edge as it tasted better reheated than the Pat's reheated, although I want to be clear, both were better tasting freshly made, nothing is gained by saving for re-heating later.  Both this review and Pat's review are based on a single sandwich from each, while both restaurants make these assembly line style, each one is still uniquely made and there could be significant taste differences between sandwiches made at the same restaurant but at different times.",0,"8wLekG_0JlfvtJYyWCE0Tg"

I know, it really doesn't make much sense to be working out and then watching something that makes you feel like you just gained some weight and clogged your arteries, even from just watching it on tv. Nothing says, ""eat me"" like a perfect combination of grease, cheese, and steak on toasted bread! It was then I decided that the next time I set foot in Philly, I needed to come see this place firsthand.   Throughout the television special, I was intrigued by the rivalry that is Geno's vs Pat's. After my workout, I knew that I needed to decide for myself, which cheese steak place reigns supreme?! Since I was in town for the weekend to visit my best friend and I just recently saw this special on tv, I knew this was something I could finally cross off my Philly bucket list.   This cheese steak joint is a hard sight to miss because it looks like something that escaped from fabulous Las Vegas with all the neon lit signs that remind you that you're at Geno's. With Pat's just a few feet away, it just makes it more fun to experience this Philly rivalry. As you walk up to the window to place your order, you become overwhelmed with a sense of pride for the police and fire departments all over with the wall of PD / FD patches decorating one of the walls. That's pretty awesome because these people deserve a lot of respect for protecting our citizens and keeping us safe. However, there is a racist sticker near the window where you order. ""Press 1 for English. Press 2 for Deportation."" Take it how you may, but I guess... it adds character to the place? Whatever. I came for Cheese steak. Not for someone's opinions of immigration in the United States. As I looked at the menu, I was disappointed that the only options you had for your cheese steak were three types of cheese. Maybe I should have also tried the fries, I hear they're awesome.  When I finally took a bite of my Philly Cheese Steak, I was a little underwhelmed. I was expecting my cheese steak to be piping hot but instead it was warm. I just anticipated it to be oozing with all sorts flavor. It wasn't bad, but I guess I was expecting more because of all the hype, the line you can see snaking around the corner and celebrity endorsements (you can see the celebrity photos plastered like wallpaper along the ceiling). In the back of my head, I already knew that this was a tourist trap but I'm still glad I got to try a Philly Cheese Steak at the famous Geno's Steaks. I think it's a must if you're coming to visit. I look at coming here as more of an experience, since I don't regularly crave Philly Cheese Steaks.

My friends and I came here after partying at some lounge, and my first impression was when did I leave Philly and come to Vegas? This place was lit up like it should be on the Vegas Strip! Once we got on line it was only a 10 maybe 15 minute wait, definitely not the worst I've experienced. So while we were waiting my friend instructed me on the proper way to order because apparently if you order incorrectly you get sent to the the back of the line (that would suck). Lucky for me I ordered properly and got a whiz wit which is a steak with cheese whiz and onions.   My friends cousin suggested I put some ketchup on it as well so I did and we all sat down. I took my first bite and down to the last I thought it was really good, it definitely hit the spot!   My experience was different from a lot of the reviews, first being I didn't know about all the hype, I was just brought here. Secondly my bread was just fine and my meat was not dry. However I can definitely see where the place can loose its stars. I personally was very content with the food I had just eaten but I wasn't wowed by it so I can understand how someone who has bought into the hype can easily be disappointed. The wait in line wouldn't have bothered me even if it were longer only because if your out at 3 in the morning wanting to eat a cheese steak or anything else for that matter, you really have nothing better to do. However I do have to agree with it being a bit expensive for drunken food and I'm from NY. The cheese steak was $8.50 and $3.50 for fries ($4 if you want cheese) which tasted more like tater tots than fries.  Overall I think the place was just fine but I am interested in some of the other places that some of these reviews say are better, the next time I'm in Philly.",2,"-tvkjRNyZkIB3ndIftI7Yg"

All Philadelphians have their specific favorite and most don't agree on who makes the best in town.  Many Philadelphians think Geno's is the best and it's a great place to go if you are only going to try one cheese steak when you are visiting Philly due to their reputation and wild neon ambiance.    I personally find the best cheese steaks to have the cheese melted on the roll under the meat because it keeps the roll from getting soggy & you can really taste the cheese.  That is not how Geno's makes theirs.  On the other hand, they are better than most small, single store cheese steak restaurants who make cheese steaks similarly to the way Geno's makes theirs (with the cheese mixed in with the meat).     One of my favorites is actual a single storefront but my other favorite (my #1) has multiple locations and it's most famous location is on South Street with big black and white checker tiles on the outside.

After walking around the city, decided to go to Geno's since I see it everytime on TV (during commercial if a sporting event in Philadelphia, Food Network, etc).  So one would assume it would be good since it's on television.  This honestly was the biggest waste of money and till this day, still hate myself for eating that dump.  First off, people that work there were rude as hell (I think it's just how Philadephians are).  I ordered a cheesesteak with light cheese whiz, fries, and a drink.  Believe it was around $14.50, which is also the biggest rip off on Earth.  I can get better food at a McDonalds' than this place.  The bread was hard as a rock, fries were awful, had no flavor even though I poured about half the salt in the shaker, and on top of that, they charge you for getting another fountain drink.  The meat was fatty, even fact, my gf was tearing off the fat that was on her sandwich.  It had no flavor whatsoever and SO BAD.  I actually had to force myself to eat cuz I felt bad for throwing it away.    I wouldnt even recommend this dump to my worst enemy.  This is just a tourist trap and highly recommend NOT GOING HERE!!!  I seriously have no idea how some of these people have the courage to write a positive review for this place.  Im only giving a one star because I have to fill it out, if not, I would give a 0.

TIP: If you go, order the food when your about 15 minutes out and just have someone jump out and pick it up for you. Don't attempt to find parking.   I recommend you don't go.

Being iconic, however, says nothing about quality or the dining experience.  Let's look at the dining experience first.  Under the best of circumstances you order from a long outdoor counter, and have a foil-wrapped sandwich literally thrown at you moments later.  The counter isn't wiped as frequently as hygiene would dictate, and there are few places to sit and eat.  Add to this the fact that the counter help is predictably gruff and short-tempered.  It would take some remarkable food to create a dining environment that any sane person would want to repeat.  Unfortunately, the cheesesteaks just don't measure-up.  The meat is both loaded with gristle and cooked to the point of being dry.  I prefer melted provolone and onions, and the cheese has always been only partially melted.  I've eaten at four of Philly's ""big name"" cheesesteak spots (Geno's, Pat's, Jim's and Dalessandro's), and believe that Geno's is the worst of the four.",13,"yXIFCpTAJkKzyoWXm4opqg"

I would also assume if you are a food lover, then you've seen the many challenges on the Food Network that pit them head to head against each other.   Now, I might be making an even crazier assumption here, but if you are anything like me, you've been wanting to come to Philly just to do your own taste comparison. It's okay, you can admit it, you're in a safe zone here. No judgment.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  THE EXPERIENCE Geno's and Pat's are indeed literally across the street from one another, probably within 300 feet. I had no preference which I ate at first, but it happened that Pat's had an open parking space just outside their place, so we stopped there.   Less than 10 minutes after splitting a steak with my two young boys, we were ordering our second steak here @ Geno's. The time was about 11:45am, so there were no crowds. If there is one thing I immediately notice it was how incredibly clean Geno's is, both inside and out. I'm talking immaculate. The exterior counters were spotless, the sidewalks and table were swept clean and inside the kitchen was like stepping into an operation room in a hospital. It was so clean that it looked almost new. This was a huge unexpected bonus for a germaphobe like me.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  THE CHEESE-STEAK COMPARISON Let me just say as plainly as I can that you probably will not be disappointed with either of these steaks. I spent hours reading through local blogs (not yelp) trying to decide who has the best cheese-steaks in the city. After all, I may not be back this way in a very long time and wanted the best experience. Pat's consistently made multiple top 10 lists while Geno's did not. I almost decided to try two other places instead, but stuck to my guns and fulfill a long standing food goal.  I'm not a fan of cheese whiz, which is an understatement. I hate the stuff and wanted to go for provolone instead. But I didn't. I wanted a real Philly experience, so  I chose the whiz and the whiz won me over. I can't explain why it tastes so different and so much better on an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak, but it does. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the flavor was and I am now a converted believer.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  FINAL THOUGHTS These two cheese-steak Titans are worthy of a visit despite what you might read in other comparative articles on the internet. Locals may feel there are other places around town that are better, but I can say for certain I was happy with my first authentic experience being at these two long standing locations. Both have been in continuous operation since the 1930's.   As an out-of-town tourist, I have to give the edge to Pat's. They seem to dice the meat more finely whereas Geno's gives you larger slices. I think that slight difference makes ALL the difference. I also liked the fries much much better @ Pat's but the bread was more to my liking @ Geno's.  Decide for yourself, but my personal taste preference leans heavily towards Pat's. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i78BZfqyQB0",61,"JjXuiru1_ONzDkYVrHN0aw"

Unfortunately, he wanted to go to the place 'that was in the Motown Philly' video.  Some convoluted logic if you ask me but he was my guest.    Here is a recap:  1. I could care less if he has 'English-only signs' or 'Chinese-only signs' or 'Pig-Latin only signs.'   2. Servers aren't rude at Geno's.  They are just a bit surly and impatient.  There's a difference.  If you are from the Northeast, you understand this.  If not, you will likely think they are just rude.     3. Geno's uses Amoroso's rolls which is a good thing.  Philly bakeries make some of the best rolls in the country and Amoroso produces a good product even if they produce large amounts for commercial use.  Have heard anything that it is due to the quality of the water, ingredients, or the bakeries in the area.  Problem is that they come early in the morning and by the late evening they tend to a bit on the stale side.   4. Quality of the meat though is not a plus at Geno's.  They use a crappy cut of meat and it shows up in the taste.  You don't need top of the line sirloin.  Just better than what Geno's uses.  4. Servers there can make a real mess of cheesesteak including getting way too much grease with the meat.  Sloppy steak = soggy roll and this is a major no-no when serving any hot sandwich on a roll.  Presentation matters especially when it effects the overall taste of the food.  Geno's fails here way too often.   5. Geno's also screws up your order too often also.  C'mon guys I worked at a sandwich shop and it isn't that hard to remember an order with 2 stinking sandwiches.   They are also irritable when you try to get them to fix it.  You screwed it up, you should fix it with no questions asked.   6. 'Freedom Fries' stink at Geno's.  Avoid them and save your $4-5 bucks.   Ditto on the Roast Pork sandwich.  One of the worst in South Philly. 7. This is a tourist trap and the prices reflect that a bit.  $2 bucks for a soda?  $8.50 for a cheesesteak?   My friend wound up disappointed especially when he got a soggy mess when he unwrapped his cheesesteak with wiz which of course didn't have onions.    Told him that we would have been better off going to places that were pretty close by that just used a better cut of meat and didn't make such a mess.  He said now he knows and that knowing is half the battle.",6,"Pq_okYAHQMxr0pxo_A2KDw"

Because 'celebrities' once dined at this spot, it's automatically supposed to make the food something delicious?! Ridiculous. Don't. Just don't waste your time and money.",5,"JIB9uxtJlYYUaI-dDoCDNA"

It's important to note they are cash only. If you don't have any cash when you show up, no worries. There is an ATM right across the street. Make sure you know what you want when you get to the window and that you know how to properly order it. And have your cash ready. They try to move people through as quickly as possible to keep the line moving. Parking is super limited and often full. If you have other people with you it might be worth it to drop someone off to wait in line for the food while the other person drives around. That's what we did and it seemed to work out.

The bread at Geno's is chewier and the meat is cut into larger pieces that is mildly more chewier, and slightly less meat compared to Jim's. The onion at Geno's was cooked, but less cooked than Jim's, but still provided the onion sweetness that I like. If you eat the cheesesteak vertically, all the sauce will collect at the bottom so beware.   The line is pretty long and parking is almost nonexistent. The line goes by really fast though and the wait after you order is only like 3 minutes (at most). I ordered one cheesesteak and it came out within seconds. I also ordered French fries ($4) which came in a cup. They are skinny and crispy but nothing really special about it. I shared it with my friend who thought the oil/smell of the fries was strong. The French fries/cheese fries/drinks are ordered at the counter next to the cheesesteak counter. The other count is also relatively quick.  Casual outdoor self-seating available.

The cheese is watery and it doesn't have that much flavor. However, the steak is tasty and flavorful. The onions have a weird taste but it is still good.   If you are the kind of person, who likes meat and are not a big fan of cheese, Geno's will be a better choice for you. I think both Geno's and Pat's are almost the same and one will be more superior than other depending on your preference.",6,"fqOrzfgeKFuTrQnwaxJYVw"

It is cash only so luckily there was an ATM across the street or we would've been screwed. We probably waited about 20-30 minutes to place our order which wasn't too bad considering how long the line was. I ordered the cheesesteak whiz which had the traditional cheese, steak and onions whole my friend got the cheesesteak with provolone cheese. I would recommend the whiz because when it's just the provolone the sandwich is pretty dry, so the warm cheese on the whiz really gives it moisture. I really like the grilled onions on the sandwich because they were perfectly crunchy and still had a lot of flavor.

I left a review for Pat's and was contacted by an imbecile who was so bothered by my review because I'm not a local and that I should only review establishments that are local to me. Sorry, that's not how this works. I'm from metro Detroit Michigan, and yes, I'm going to be reviewing a place in Philadelphia.  Every time I have visited Philly, I have eaten at Geno's. Most recently, I also grabbed a cheesesteak and cheese fries from Pat's to split with my fiance and share, to decide which was better. I am going to say, in my opinion and my opinion only, Geno's is far superior on every level. The amount of steak was plentiful, the bread was fresh and the overall quality is superb. They also give you a very generous portion of fries and cheese, much more than Pat's gives, and the quality and taste is far better. It's also cheaper than Pat's.   When I order a whiz without, Geno's actually gives me the cheesesteak without onions! This wasn't the case at Pat's. The simpleton I referenced earlier stated I should suck it up because who cares if there's a little taste of onions. Uh, I do, right here, buddy! I hate onions. I've hated onions all thirty-three years of my life. They nauseate me. If I order something without onions, it better come without onions. Geno's has come through for me all three times I've eaten here. The service is fast, efficient and friendly. The employees have also been a delight and didn't make me feel like I had to rush through the line and get out of the way immediately.   Locals can call it a tourist trap all they want. They can try to tell me the quality sucks and I'm wasting my time. I really, really don't care.

Honestly not my first choice, but they are both open 24/7 so it was the first that came to mind so late at night.   I was surprised to find that a cheesesteak was $10, but shrugged it off. Geno's is most certainly a tourist spot, but it's not a trap. These cheesesteak are most definitely original Philly-style cheesesteaks and won't shatter any dreams.   Are they the best? Probably not. Do they satisfy my cheesesteak craving? Yes.   Going to Geno's late at night I got faced no line and unluckily faced pre-chopped steak; this makes for a dryer and less-tender steak.

But go we did, and eat we did, so that we could experience some of the more famous dueling Philly sandwich shops around.    We started our adventure at Pat's splitting one Philly before walking across the street to have  another here at Geno's.  First off, i'll say that Geno's is definitely the cleaner of the two.  Shiny, polished, and ridiculously fast.  From order to sandwich in hand must've been 3 minutes. We split their Cheese steak with whiz ($10 with tax)  The Philly at Geno's has meat that is cut in long thin slices, comes with cooked onions and whiz.  Here's the thing....the sandwich was lacking in flavor completely, although it looked delicious.  My girlfriend on the other hand preferred Geno's to Pat's (so taste buds my vary).    Geno's customer service was top notch, nice, informative, not pushy (like I thought Pat's staff were), and when we get our sandwich whole, they were more than happy to cut it in half for us so that we could share.  Do I have anything bad to say about Gino's?  No.  Outside of their sandwich having a lack of flavor.  I personally think they lose the war with Pat's, but my girlfriend disagrees so the war continues.  Don't take my word on it though....

EXPERIENCE: I went with the steak and whiz. It was very busy on a Saturday afternoon so my first tip is I you are going be prepared to wait. It's a hot spot that has been touted as one of the best cheesesteak experiences in the city so people are going to come to see for themselves.   The clerks and workers are somewhat rude- if they smell tourist on you and you ask questions about the menu or options, you are getting attitude. A gentleman in front of me was scolded- hurried, and embarrassed by the old woman working for asking the difference in cheese. Poor guy.   FOOD : I am not going to say Pats is better or Tony Lukes is better etc, but in all honesty- it's a damn cheesesteak sandwich. Is it good? YES. Is it worth dying for? NO. Geno's was good don't get me wrong but personally I don't get the whole aura about it all.

That way they can whip out them sandwiches just as fast as possible.  The bread is fresh, firm and has great flavor.  It holds up to the meats cheeses and sauces.  The meat is a little thicker than others and the flavor comes across as a little salty.  But as far as cheesesteaks are concerned, Gino's is the absolute top.

There is a sketchy ATM nearby as a last resort.  The sandwich was ok. The cheese whiz actually tasted quite good, the steak was tender too. However, the bread was a little too soft in my opinion.

I finally had a real Philly Cheesesteak from Philly and it was good. I kept it simple and local. I did my search when I visited Philly and of course two places popped up, Pat's and Geno's. So I flipped a coin and got Geno's. After reading the reviews from both I figured I wasn't going to pick a bad one between the two. Even though Covid is a thing right now it didn't seem to slow these guys down.  I wasn't expecting such a fast and efficient service. At one window you order and pay for your Cheese steak. The other window you order/pay for your fries and drinks. By the way they only take cash and good luck with the street parking. Just circle the block you'll find a spot.   They have a simple menu right there at the window and there is nothing to it. I was in line for about 5 minutes and there was a couple people in front of me and during that time I was able to figure out and see what I wanted to order. Each cheese steak had an image and price next to it on the menu. I picked a regular Cheese Steak with mushrooms but what took me for a spin was the fact that they asked me what kind of cheese do I want with an option of WHIZ cheese! What? Why would anyone want Cheese whiz on a Philly? So I asked the guy at the window how do the locals eat it he replied ""with Cheese Whiz"" at that point I said give it to me. literally a minute a later I have a hot wrapped Philly Cheese Steak in my hands. Then I went to the next window and ordered my Fries and drink. Ok, so I'm not happy with the price but I will jump ahead and say the quality of the steak and fries are worth it. I spent about $18 on a combo but I would have spent that much at fancy restaurant and I'm sure it would have taken long and not be as good. So how was the sandwich? It was good! It's street food and it's not a gourmet item. The Cheese Whiz melted with the heat of the steak into a salty cheese sauce that completes this Philly. I loved every chewy bite. The bread was soft and the steak was tender and not stringy. You can really taste the quality of the meat, it's not like that cheap meat you get at the grocery store. The mushrooms (if you are in to mushrooms), were thick slices and for me adds a little something extra. The fries were crispy and fresh and remined me of McDonald fries but better. You get your money's worth in fries.   To recap: Fast simple service. A little pricey but worth it. Cheese Whiz is how the locals eat it and it's worth it (you won't be sorry). Bring Cash (yes there are ATM's near by) and circle the block for parking.  Geno's has a great Philly Cheese steak and I'm only sad that I was there for one afternoon because I would have tried Pat's the next day to compare. The next time I visit Philly I'll have to try Pat's to see what the battle is all about. Enjoy everyone.",2,"R1VROQ8wwdEM5RbtFx2cqA"

I know there are many many places in Philly that offer this iconic staple, but we stuck to the YouTube standard Geno's vs. Pat's. We bought 2 from each, so we could have 1/2 a sandwich each. They were both ordered the same, wit onions and cheese wiz. Both were $10 each, so I didn't feel too abused. But the rest is a difference. You get a lot more meat at Pat's and it's chopped, but it lacks flavor. I think it needs some seasoning while it's cooked, but it's a decent $10 sandwich. Geno's is a little sparse on the meat, but we all liked the slices and it did have a hit of some seasoning, and we thought the bread was better. Their bread seemed a bit more firm and had a better chew. Both had decent cheese whiz, but how can you mess that up? So, the winner by a narrow margin in Geno's. Oh, and Geno's looks cleaner and is brighter, but I'd hate to use that to critique the food. Usually the older more authentic places taste better. Philly looks like an interesting city.

I really dig the decor, colors and vibe. It felt like Philly to me. It was lunch time, but not too crowded, just steady. I ordered two provvy ""wit."" At 9 bucks a steak, I was hoping for a hit. The best things about the steaks were definitely not the steak. The wrapping paper had more flavor than the meat. Yet, the bread was very fresh, crisp outside, soft inside, and the onions had a perfect saute. They weren't finely chopped, rather a nice big dice on 'em. I love onions that way. I think next time I'll order the whiz cheese b/c the provvy didn't do it for me.  Great story to prove the cheesesteak feud is truly real. My mom forgot to have me order mushrooms for her steak. So, she took her Geno's steak in 'the other place's' wrapper since we were sitting at the competitions table and eating their fries (which RULE, btw) and walked up to their window to order some 'shrooms. I repeatedly said, ""don't do it!"" Alas, she didn't listen. One whiff or glance at the sandwich in her hand and they yelled ""that ain't our steak, and we ain't puttin' our mushrooms on it!""

Not as good as Pat's (see my review on Pat's), but I think it really comes down to personal preference when judging these behemoths of cheesesteaks.   What I did like about Geno's, was that it seemed like a classier joint. But, in the same sense that a south Vegas strip club is slightly classier than an Atlantic City strip club. So, don't get too excited there. It just seemed more clean and sanitary than Pat's. I was a little less worried about catching some disease from eating the food.   what I didn't like about Geno's: - the baguette was soft, and not toasty like Pat's - the onions were massive chunks, not finely chopped... I'm not a fan of the onion, so this was a MASSIVE turn-off - the beef is sliced, and not chopped  - it also seemed like the sandwich was slightly smaller than the cheesesteak at Pat's, and less filling as a result  The neighborhood around Pat's and Geno's is quite sketchy and borderline-ghetto.

He's got a sweet setup!!! He's lived in Bryn Mawr all his life and only been to south Philly once when all of us online friends dared him to go to south Philly bc  he was all messed up on jolt soda and melaluca pills and on a 73 hour world of warcraft binge, so we nicknamed him south Philly Billy!!!  He was so hungry and delirious we told him to go and get a real cheese steak from Geno's and he did it!!!! He usually gets his steaks from Sun Valley and that place stinks blue Nav'i poopers!!! He said Geno's steaks was like tasting what Avatar unobtainium  would taste like if it were in cheesesteak form!!! I wish they delivered to Bryn Mawr!!   Me and south Philly Billy are online world of war craft friends but we also call each other and watch ""American idol"" together and I had missed a bunch of episodes bc of my current active social life and he had them tivo'd so I flew to Bryn Mawr and played world of warcraft and watched American idol together, especially bc our friend Neil was gonna be on!! Neil totally rocked the place!!! And he was totally sweating less than usual!!! But that super nerd Simon wouldn't let Neil pass. phwwwww. I totally think this idol is rigged, Neil was the best!!!!! So we drank away our disappointment....we each drank, like, 4 jolt colas!!! And I was super messed up and I dared him that we should go to Geno's steaks in south Philly...all that cool cola courage made me so impulsive!!! So we did!!  South Philly Billy is a total tough guy, so he insisted on driving...well we made it to GENO'S Steaks in South Philly and no one threw 40 oz bottles at South Philly Billy's Mom's minivan!! That was such a plus.   The line was super duper long and we got in and South Phil Bill said that I needed to summon all my Seinfeld ""Soup Nazi"" power and to carefully walk in line and order fast; otherwise they might send me to the back of the line!!   Gollly!  that place smelled so good!! There were a couple of girls in line ahead of us and they had lots of hairspray and makeup and it looked like their hair was riding a wave. South Philly Billy is totally a ladies man, he has gotten the furthest out of all of us online gamers bc he is by far the best looking....he once touched a girl where she peed!!!! Honest Abe!!! So he started talking to these girls with the wave hair but I got nervous bc I didn't want to cheat on Katia so I didn't say anything and just listened.....the girls were natives of the neighborhood and told us we better know how to order!!! I thought : ""Geez Louise Antifreeze how hard is it to order a cheesesteak!??!?!?""  The line slowly moved and South Philly Billy got his steak and all of a sudden it was my turn!!! I was so nervous I was sweating like crazy!!! I slowly walked up and stuttered "" one south Philadelphia cheesesteak please""   Guy: ""What the F#ck do you want?""  Me: ""One South Philly Cheesesteak please""  Guy: ""Wiz wit?""   Me: What game is that????   Guy: ""get ta the back of the line schnook!!!

LOL, good job paying Food Network for talking that one up. Anyone with half a set of taste buds will know that Geno's cheesesteak tastes like day old cardboard layered in yummy cheese on the stalest bread in all of Philly.  I mean, they have sliced steak, cut into the biggest slicest ever! They're thick slices that are tough and hard to chew. I could've chipped a tooth. The meat in general was lacking in every department. Less meat, tough meat, thick sliced meat. It was just BAD! And the bread was bad! The only saving grace is cheese but c'mon.

Located in the heart of South Philadelphia, across the street from their rival Pat's. Geno's was open in 1966 by Joey Vento and wanted to do something a little different from Pat's. Instead of having the beef (ribeye steak) chopped, he wanted to have it sliced, which makes for a chewier bite.   Anyways, my husband, our little girl dog and I came here at 2 am, Friday morning. After a very long flight and a horrible 4 hour layover at another airport, we knew we wanted to at least try this place after finally arriving in the city of brotherly love. Luckily Geno's & Pat's are 24 hours and both have dog friendly, outdoor seating. And at this time, there is no long wait to order.   We ended up getting:  Cheese Steak With Whiz + Onions, $10 after tax- I have seen numerous of talk about how you should order a cheesesteak with cheese whiz but to be honest, it does overpower the meat and would probably prefer to have this sandwich with American or provolone. Anyways, the meat itself was bland, doesn't seem like they season their meat. But the chew of the meat didn't bother me, even though it was sliced instead of chopped. This sandwich was average at best.  To be honest, after we had tried this place, I was wondering what was all the fuss about with cheesesteaks. But of course, we had to go across the street to check out Pat's (and eventually to other places that sell cheesesteak in this city).   Please note that this place is CASH ONLY. Make sure to have your order ready when you get to the window. If not, the employee taking your order may be mean to you or give you attitude. It's not that hard, just tell them if you want onions or not, the type of sandwich with what kind of cheese and pay. Your order will be ready pretty soon.   Overall, this place is just average at best. The food is not a good representation of what cheesesteaks are supposed to taste like. But come here if you wish for the novelty of it and the tourist in you and then move on (and promise yourself that you will get a cheesesteak somewhere in the city to get a true taste of what it is supposed to taste like).",2,"3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg"

I live in NY, but everytime I pass by Philly I HAVE to get a cheesesteak. After trying both Pat's and Geno's it was obvious to me there was a clear cut winner AND it wasn't Geno's. Despite all the hype and fanfare, including the number of celebrities who have eaten here and the all-out bright decor, it came down to the cheesesteak.  I ordered the ""Cheesesteak Wit"" and there were a number of reasons why it wasn't what I expected. First, the bread is not toasted well enough and a bit hard. It's pretty bland and none of the steak, cheese or juices really soak into it. This leads me to my 2nd criticism and that is the steak and cheese. There was a major lack of steak in my cheesesteak, c'mon! I felt I was ripped off a bit after spending $9.75 on one of these bad boys. How can they not at least fill up the bread with some meat, if they claim to be the best? You can't cheapen the experience for your customers when your competitor is right across the street. Third, besides a lack of steak, the steak was also bland and there just wasn't enough cheese on it. It was just a ""steak"" sandwich.   As I said, I was really disappointed and if this is the way they have been operating for decades I really don't know how people think they have the ""best"" cheesesteak.",4,"m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ"

First you had to get your sandwich from one window and your fries from another. Even though the wait was extremely short, those precious seconds detract from the heat of your cheesesteak. What if the lines were long? What then? I may just not be familiar with the system. And then, the sandwich was a whopping $9. That seems like a bit much for what it was. It took me like one minute to consume my half (that could have been my extreme hunger or eagerness...doubtful). And finally, the quality was just not great. It was a measly sandwich with a tiny bit of meat, barely perceptible cheese, and rubbery soft bread.  This sandwich tasted like it was thawed from the freezer and just cooked.

When eating the meat alone Geno's has bigger slices with more beef flavor. The bread looked fluffy and fresh. How could they lose? It came down to the full package bite. The onions were more steamed than grilled. They were soft, but were not cooked long enough to get that great caramelization action. So it gave off a raw onion flavor instead of a sweet onion flavor. The beef at Geno's did not have as much seasoning as Pat's. And the bread was just too much, too filling. So you add this together and the edge goes to Pat's.

Geno's is across the street from the Pats and Pats has the better cheesesteak in my opinion.  Geno's cheesesteaks seem to have more emphasis on the (firmer) bread and onions than Pats. Pats cheesesteaks have more meat and juiciness though.   --- Detailed Review ---  For parking, there is street parking nearby as people come and go from Pats and Geno's. Geno's is cash only and a normal cheesesteak is (currently) $10. This price (~$10) seems to be the norm around Philly.  Moving onto the cheesesteaks, I ordered wiz wit (cheesesteak with cheese whiz and onions). Geno's keeps the meat in slices instead of chopping them up like many other cheesesteak institutions. This means the meat takes up less space. This is analogous to having 8 pieces of stacked and flat paper versus 8 pieces of shredded and crumbled up paper. Still, it just felt like the meat was lacking something, whether it was volume or taste. The bread was a little firmer and tougher than I would have liked, but held the cheesesteak together well.  I did enjoy the other aspects of the cheesesteak though! I liked the onions that were not overcooked to the point of no taste. Instead, I could actually taste some onion flavor and texture. Geno's puts a nice amount of onions on as well. The cheese whiz was nice and tasty. It was also put on the bread (instead of the meat like Pats). The cheesesteak was cleaner and easier to eat than Pats, but lacked the juiciness and flavor from the meat that Pats has.   On another note, one of the more controversial aspects to Geno's is their sign stating ""This is America. When ordering, please speak English.""   I definitely needed this sign, because I was going to order in Chinese (Mandarin). Of course, I am being sarcastic. I feel like this sign has caused Geno's a great deal of (racism) trouble and tension. I feel like the sign doesn't belong here. In fact, I am not sure who the sign is for, because people who generally can't speak English, cannot read English either. As always with English, there are exceptions to this and some people may be able to read and not speak English. The sign did not bother me drastically, but it was something to note.  Regardless, I would suggest trying Pats first, as it is better and the original. Then, if you still have room, maybe try Geno's across the street to compare.",10,"stUwmVSvwF0sb-NE7IRM-w"

Unlike then, I did not have a few draft beers first (a firefighter tradition back then), instead I drove three hours then went right here.  First, a friend went to Pat's cheesesteaks across the street while I went to Genos. Both only accept cash and have two lines you need to wait in - one for the cheesesteak, another for fries and soda, silly system but I understand they do it to keep the lines moving and don't force people just wanting a cheesesteak to wait in line for someone getting fries or soda.  Our plan was very ""scientific"" to each get the same type of cheesesteak - ""wit,"" (onions), mushrooms and peppers  except my friend was to get American cheese and I was to get cheese wiz.   Then we broke the sandwiches in half, giving the other half to the other person to compare each to figure out which was better.  We did ""the experiment"" and find we both liked the wiz better than the American cheese, but otherwise both cheesesteaks were pretty much the same. Not really worth the $13 cost, and not any better than restaurants and other places in the area that serve cheesesteaks.  I guess it makes sense that both places have survived and have thrived for decades competing across the street from each other to have products and service that equal each other.  Genos appears more cop and firefighter friendly based on the memorial plaque they have prominently displayed, so I went here and asked my friend to go to Pat's.

Better than most cheesesteaks you've had outside of Philly, but by no means the best in Philly. Not a bad starting point if you're planning to compare several cheesesteaks.

I headed to Geno's and Boyfriend grabbed Pat's. He had only ever had pat's and I said this was unacceptable. He also didn't want to get whiz and I said we had to get whiz at both to have a comparison. He reluctantly agreed.  Walking up to Geno's, it looked like a long line but that was because it was a bunch of people standing around the fries and soda line.   Growing up in Orlando I have been annoyed more than once by a tourist, so I looked up the proper ordering technique and did my best to execute it properly. It seemed very appreciated because the guys were friendly. I had to ask if I was at the right window and they said I was and I rattled off ""one wit whiz"". They handed it to me, I said thank you.I already had my cash out. They said ""here, have a pen for a souvenir"". Victory! I suspect it was a reward for my effort. The soda and fry window was a cluster with tourists who didn't understand. I didn't waste my time on the fries, I was there to try the steak, but they did have birch beer on fountain which I happily got. We don't have birch beer on fountain in Tallahassee or anywhere I have been in Florida...   Ok, the cheese steak sandwich:  It was good and flavorful. It tasted like it was seasoned with Italian spices and I liked that it was shaved instead of chopped. Their onions weren't anything to write home about but they put a generous amount of whiz on. Their bread was outstanding. It had a great flavor that really added to the sandwich. It brought out the flavors of the beef and added its own dimension. It was what I hoped it would be.  Prices are less at Geno's compared to pats. For sure on the soda which was 2 dollars at Geno's but 2.50 at Pats.   I preferred Geno's to Pats in the Whiz category. See my Pat's review for the contrasts and the revelation that was provolone.  **People have remarked in reviews that they didn't like the signage etc,. I didn't notice it but maybe that was because I wasn't standing in line. I didn't have any issues with service because I was kind and tried to do things properly.

To be completely honest, not even sure if I got my cheesesteak from Geno's or Pat's since they are just across from one another....  My husband and I were in Philly for a small trip and he really wanted to try Pat and Geno's, which in my opinion are way over-hyped. I've definitely had better elsewhere. But when in Rome...  First, parking is a nightmare. Good luck finding a spot. We were planning on getting a sandwich from both places to determine which one was better but ended up just getting from Geno's because I ran out of the car while my husband circled the block.   Have to say the lady who took my order was super rude - you'd think she would be used to tourists and them not knowing all the lingo or how to order ""correctly."" You order at the first window and if you want drinks or sides you have to go to another window. I just assumed my sandwich would be there but you get it at the first window. Sorry - I didn't know! She gave me the stink eye when I came back and shoved my sandwiches at me. Since we didn't park we decided to drive out of the city and find the nearest rest stop...which unfortunately wasn't until an hour later. Needless to say my husband wasn't a huge fan of the his sandwich cause he got the cheese wiz and it had cooled and his bread was soggy. But I really liked mine! I got provolone cheese and it came with onions. The bread, I think, was the best part though. I did like the sandwich, but the customer service was really lacking.

When we were the next to be served, we heard someone from another window say something along the lines of ""Can I help the next person?"" so, thinking he was talking to us since we were next in line, we took one or two steps to the left (out of the original line) and toward that other window and then realized that the other windows were for drinks or sides only. So we stepped BACK to our original spot, and the older man taking orders said to us, ""Line starts back there,"" motioning to where we got in line 20 minutes before. We proceeded to explain that we WERE in line, even asked the guy in line behind us to vouch for us, and he laughed it off and said ""I don't know, I don't know...""

I understand that this is Philly and all that, but customers are customers and should not be made to feel insulted.   Other than the rude service, the sandwiches were okay.

Some locals took me here to experience ""The best or at least the most famous cheese steak is South Philly"". I hope it is not the best because if it means trying anything worse I am done with the experience. As for it being most famous this is more likely as this place is lit up like a traveling carnival where you pay a ridiculous amount but still feel cheap after the experience.   Geno's serves up three items: a steak sandwich with a choice of three cheeses, fries and sodas. So as specialists, one would expect something a little special.   The steak is sliced, not chopped, flavorless and not seasoned. The sprinkled diced grilled onions added upon request don't add enough to the taste. If you want really bland go for the provolone, you won't notice it is there.        Oddly the worst cheese ever, American, is a step up. Finally the whiz, probably not an actual cheese, provides the gooey messy textures one might expect but the combined flavors again are absent.   $7+ for sandwich $4+ for small cup of cheese fries + soda = $15. to sit out side underneath a white neon canopy.  While we were eating, the nearby insect zapper stayed busy and the bugs continued to meet an unsatisfying fate while I dined.    I don't ever not finish my food. This once,  I left a quarter of my sandwich not because I was full or bloated, but instead I was bored and lost my appetite while eating.

Even when our conversation was over...he would re-introduce himself to confirm Geno's is the place. Alright pal...we're in.  Dude must have been drunk. We show up to Geno's, put our order in. Steak, provolone, onions, peppers.  Now...I was unaware there's 2 ways to serve a Philly...chopped, or sliced. Geno's serves up sliced meat.  When we open sandwich...what do we see? Think strips of this pallid grey meat...grilled pepper and onions haphazardly thrown on the top of the sandwich...and barely any recognizable cheese. Whatever...flavor is what matters, right?  The best I could describe it is...meh... The bread was good. The meat...tasted like it wasn't seasoned...and had a bit of a tough bite to it. The peppers and onions...no seasoning as well, so it made an already bland sandwich...more bland. OH!

As you approach the intersection with Genos and Pats you've got drunk people crossing from between parked cars all over the place. We got unbelievably lucky and caught somebody leaving right across from Genos as we pulled up. I imagine parking would have sucked without that lucky break. Also I should mention, if you can't parallel park, you may never leave your vehicle in Philly.  We got out across the street and the line was pretty long. But the entire process takes under a minute from ordering to leaving with your food. It's cash only, but we came prepared. My bills were kind of course, and were sticking together. It took me a little longer than it should to produce the cash, and the person taking the money didn't hold back one bit from rolling her eyes and motioning to get it moving. We assumed people in Philly must just be dicks, as this was our first encounter in the city, but after we left the next day we realized out of all the people we ran into, it was only her.  Anyway, we got our food and booked it to the safety of our rest stop to wind down. We know Geno's and Pats are pretty kitschy, but we tried the place for its historical relevance. (It also helped that they're open 24 hours.) I'll always remember it as my first authentic cheesesteak -- my gateway into a huge city full of processed meat and cheese. The bread was firm and chewy. The meat was in whole thin slices, and was even softer than it looked. The onions were cooked, but still crunchy. We've never had a sandwich with cheese wiz before, and it's amazing how well it all came together. I think I might have eaten my half in less than a minute. What an incredible experience.  After going to a bunch of other places, we voted Geno's over Pat's, but most other places seem objectively better than both.",1,"QgKpCgKqmzBDu2FI_jYyUQ"

As mentioned in my review for Pat's, I went to four cheesesteak places during my short stay in Philly over a long weekend, and had a control sandwhich, a cheesesteak with whiz and onions at each and every place so that I'd be able to fairly judge the four-way competition (Pat's, Geno's, Jim's Steaks, and Ishkabibble's).  For me, Geno's came out on top.  For starters, Geno's is a much more welcoming establishment than Pat's.  They actually appear to marginally care.  The decor is much brighter, and there's more of an energetic vibe to this place.  It also seems much cleaner, and all the photos of Geno's plastered everywhere, including the beverage cups, is an actually amusing marketing scheme.  I get it, he's a legend around here (at least for tourists?).  But when it came to my cheesesteak, the steak was thinly sliced and easy to chew, it was tender, and the balance of whiz and onions was on point.  It was a juicy, tasty morsel of sandwich and I definitely liked it more than the competition across the street.

I'm sorry I took more than five seconds to order. I didn't realize you were ACTUALLY doing me a favor by taking my hard-earned money (that's right, you're not the only people who work for a living) in exchange for shitty service and shittier food. Though I admit, at least your hot sauce is good. But you didn't make that, and I served it to myself.  This place is the EZ Bake Oven of cheese steaks. I swear. Except EZ Bake products are vaguely intriguing - especially since I can't bake for shit. There is nothing intriguing about something that takes five minutes to slap together.  I'm not saying cheesesteaks aren't great. Hell, Philadelphia born and raised, right here, son! In fact, my mom's cheesesteaks, which people tell me are quite good (I tend to stay away from my mom's cooking cause she's my mom) put me through college. That and tons of financial aid. But I digress.  Because of this, I can actually say that in my lifetime I've made at least fifty steaks from scratch. It's not hard. In fact, it's one of the easiest things you can do. By a hunk of top round and chip it. Pan fry it in some oil. Add the onions last, or they'll overcook. Scrape it into a pile the length of the bread you're using, spread good 'ole American white on top so that it melts, and then put the bread on top. Spatula underneath, flip it over, and you're done. You've got an ""American wit,"" or, for the uninitiated, a ""cheesesteak with American cheese and onions.""  Do they do this at Geno's?  No. The meat was cooked, to be sure. ""When"" is the question. If I knew I could get so much business putting under-salted beef jerky on yesterday's roll, skipping the courtesy of melting the cheese altogether, and charging eight bucks for the whole thing, I'd have skipped college and started my own steak empire so that Philly natives could hate my guts.  I know it's 3am, and I know you're hungry. If that's worth a trip to South Philly to deal with all the other drunk, pissed off people, you might as well go home and sleep it off.

She made it very clear she was not serving my wife (a black caribbean woman) by twice ignoring her and asking the gentleman behind her (White) what he was having. The cashier's behavior was very clear and because of that I would never visit this establishment again. Do not to go to Geno's for their Freedom Fries because evidently we are not as of yet free. The owners should take that cashier off the window and remind her in what country she lives and works.   More to the point however, the entire ""sandwich"" - mushy and bland, other then the overwhelming SALTINESS. Salt is not a substitute for flavor, despite what your Freedom Fries might believe.",5,"RjHJJTsoquoXWf2IEgQeqg"

Second, Geno's seems to be the cheese steak restaurant for the xenophobic, racist crowd of Philadelphia, which is a huge turn off for me.  I cannot endorse patronizing a restaurant whose owner is a bigoted racist.  I think it's highly inappropriate that there are signs and bumper stickers all over about their requirement for ""Ordering in English only"" and ""Freedom Fries.""  The entire existence of this place was a huge turn off.  And, their steaks just weren't as good as Pat's.  I can kindly say my mom paid for this, so I feel good about not giving them my own money, but the food was not good.  The steak was tough and completely flavorless.  The roll was enormous so there was just bland steak and bread to eat.  The only flavor was the Whiz, which is always good, but still.  We even got onions on the steak and couldn't taste them.  Odd.  Don't go here.  At all.  It may seem tempting from across the street when you're at Pat's, but you'll definitely thank yourself for staying at Pat's and never giving Geno's a dime.  Xenophobia is disgusting and these people should be put out of business.  Quickly.",7,"kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA"

We also asked for the hot sauce. When we ordered it, it came out in less than a minute as usual and the staffs were unfriendly as usual too. I do not mind too much about the unfriendliness as long as they are proud that they serve clean and good food since it is using a pick up your own food system. Our cheesesteaks werent hot which we thought was strange but enjoyed it since I drove 30minutes to get something that I remembered to be very good. My sister, within 12hours of having half portion of Genos cheese steak, had to go to the bathroom 6times and I, who ate the whole cheese steak went to the toilet more than 10 times. This is WITHIN 12HOURS!!!! I could not eat anything else yesterday. How dirty or old does the 'COOKED' food have to be to make people sick? It was not worth the drive, or the CASH ONLY 10bucks. Now I see why only tourists go there and not the local ppls. I will not return.",1,"VZkfSUttsSGggV0W2lsUVg"

I opened it up, caught a whiff, and couldn't get to the trash quickly enough. I couldn't even bring it up to my mouth to take a single bite because the smell of the meat was so offensive. The mere thought of it upsets my stomach a full three days later. The super fatty meat had an extremely unappealing gray color and smelled like old boiled meat. My friends braved it and took two bites each and put it in the trash too. It was just an unforgettable experience in the worst possible way.",0,"49QJ5M93aLcw6tNy7Dzi7Q"

The sandwiches here are standard prices ($7-8), all seating is outside on picnic tables under the awning. This is mostly a tourist attraction  with tons of flashing neon lights and framed celebrity photos eating the famed Geno's cheesesteak. There's a big debate over Pats vs. Genos (across the street from each other) but this debate is primarily among tourists and not natives who know of better places for a good cheesesteak. Props go to Pats though because they invented the cheesesteak and were around much longer. It's not that the cheesesteaks here are bad (they're actually quite good) it's just that they are smaller, less filled, and the lines are much much longer. If I remember correctly the steak is better at Pats and the rolls are better at Genos (or possibly vise versa) but you really need to go somewhere like Tony Lukes for something much better for the money.",2,"M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ"

First time I had a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead of shredded. Also the last time I will have a cheesesteak with sliced meat instead to shredded. What an odd concept. I will say the employees were kind and extremely fast at getting the food out so kudos to them. The cheesesteak was so basic. Just a slice of cheese, thick slices of tomatoes, a ton of onions, and let's hear it, sliced meat. Wish it was more cut up and mixed around and blended together but I suppose when you are Genos, quantity is more important than quality.",0,"YebG-Sgf9sCISS3xIqpOzw"

If I wanted cheap Italian bread made with STEAKUM meat from a hairy guy who doesn't like to prepare food with gloves, I would've...well...actually who WOULD want that?  Outdoor seating only, so it is not cold weather friendly. Also apart from the overpriced dog meat, I felt like the size of the sandwich was just downright offensive. When we asked locals about Geno's the next day, they said it was an overpriced joke too.  If you want a REAL cheese steak, go to Jim's Steaks on South. Don't wast your time at Geno's.
